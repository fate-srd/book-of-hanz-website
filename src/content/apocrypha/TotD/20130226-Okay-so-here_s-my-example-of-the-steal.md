as you make a turn down a corridor, you see two security guys guarding the door.  There&#39;s a <b>Shadowy Area</b> with crates nearby.  You manage to duck back behind the corridor again before the mooks see you.  What do you do?&quot;<br><br>(We&#39;re framing the scene here, and declaring the scene aspect <b>Shadowy Area</b>)<br><br><i>The camera shows Bund round a corner, only to glimpse a couple of bad guys, and then back around the corner, out of sight.</i><br><br>Bund:  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m guessing if these guys get a chance, they&#39;ll raise an alarm, and that&#39;s the real danger, right?&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Oh, yes.  The alarms, they will be raised.&quot;<br><br>Bund:  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to try and sneak behind those crates.  Roll Stealth.... +4 total.&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;The mooks only get a +3 Notice.  You&#39;re an <b>Unseen Predator</b>, and you get a free invoke, but not enough for a success with style and an extra free invoke.&quot;<br><br>(Bund rolls his Stealth vs the mooks&#39; Notice.  +4 is better than +3, allowing him to create the advantage <b>Unseen Predator</b>, and giving him a free invoke on it.  If he had been able to get a +6, he would have gotten two free invokes!)<br><br><i>Bund waits for his chance, and when the mooks are distracted, he rolls behind one of the crates.  The mooks think they hear something, but quickly go back to chatting.</i><br><br>Bund:  &quot;Got it.  These guys look pretty reasonable?  Like one-stress types?&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Yeah, they&#39;re one-stress box mooks.&quot;<br><br>(Transparency is usually recommended in Fate Core games)<br><br>Bund:  &quot;Okay, even with the free invoke, I&#39;m not convinced that I can do the three stress needed to one-shot the two of them.  I&#39;d like to look around and see if there&#39;s something I can climb on or something to gain an additional advantage.&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Sure, go ahead and make a Notice roll.&quot;<br><br>Bund:  &quot;+1.  I guess that&#39;s not enough, is it?&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Nope.  But that seems pretty cool, and likely, so we&#39;ll just say that there are some <b>Pipes Over the Mooks</b>, but you don&#39;t get a free invoke on them.&quot;<br><br>(Here Bund tried to Create Advantage again, but failed.  Still, the GM thinks it&#39;s a cool idea, and so allows the advantage <b>Pipes Over the Mooks</b> to be created, but Bund doesn&#39;t get a fress usage of it.)<br><br><i>The camera focuses on the pipes above the mooks&#39; heads</i><br><br>Bund:  &quot;Works for me.  I&#39;m going to try and climb up on the pipes, then.  +6, woohoo!&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re on the pipes.  And that was a success with style, so you get two invokes.&quot;<br><br>(Bund did a lot better here, probably because his Athletics is better than his Notice.  A +6 is 4 over the default target of +2, which is enough to get a success with style, and <b>two</b> free invokes of the aspect <b>Over the Mooks</b>)<br><br><i>Bund climbs up the pipes in the shadows, and then crosses over to a perfect position over their heads.  The camera looks down at the unsuspecting guards</i><br><br>Bund:  &quot;I&#39;ve got this.  I&#39;m dropping on them, so I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s fighting?  Should I save up my free invokes?&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Yeah, this is Fighting.  Go ahead and use those invokes, because after this you certainly won&#39;t be <b>Above the Mooks</b> any more, and you&#39;ll be out of the shadows, so <b>Unseen Predator</b> won&#39;t really apply either&quot;.<br><br>(Aspects apply until they&#39;re no longer narratively applicable.  The GM rules that what Bund is doing would negate both aspects.  Otherwise, he could roll without them and choose to apply them if needed)<br><br>Bund:  &quot;+1, with my three free invokes to get +7, what do they get?&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;+3 to defend.  You deal four stress, which is more than enough to take them both out.  Good thing you had that additional advantage, or you would have just gotten a boost!  How are they taken out?&quot;<br><br>(Bund&#39;s attack roll was insufficient to Take Out the mooks, but the additional bonus from his free invocations is four more than the mooks&#39; roll of +3, so he does four stress.  Each mook can take 1 stress without being knocked out, so four stress would be enough to take them both out.  The victor gets to decide what &quot;Taken Out&quot; means.)<br><br>Bund:  &quot;They&#39;re just knocked out.  I don&#39;t see any reason to kill them, and besides, blood would probably be easier to spot.&quot;<br><br><i>The camera shifts back, to better get a shot of Bund landing and hitting each mook with one leg on the way down.  The mooks crumple to the ground, and Bund looks around</i><br><br>GM:  &quot;Okay, they&#39;re unconscious.  The camera pulls back to show you standing over them - in the middle of the hallway.  There&#39;s now <b>Unconscious Bodies</b> on the floor.&quot;<br><br><i>The camera does exactly what the GM says it does</i><br><br>(Here the GM decides that it&#39;s appropriate to create a scene aspect, reflecting the bodies on the floor.  It&#39;s not something that can be Invoked easily, but it sure is fodder for a later Compel to have someone find the bodies!)<br><br>Bund:  &quot;Ugh, that&#39;s no good.  I&#39;ll haul them off behind the crates.  What do you want for that, Physique or Stealth?&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;We&#39;ll call that Physique, I guess.  It&#39;s going to be more a matter of you being able to move the bodies to a suitable place than finding one.&quot;<br><br>(Bund wants to do an Overcome to get rid of the scene aspect.  There&#39;s a couple skills that could be used, so the GM makes a call.)<br><br>Bund:  &quot;+1.  That&#39;s not good.&quot;<br><br>GM:  &quot;Nope.  You start hauling off the bodies, but they bang into a bunch of the crates and make noise.&quot;<br><br>(Bund fails his Physique roll!  To make failure interesting, the GM decides to have enough noise to call attention to what&#39;s going on.)<br><br><i>Bund hauls off the bodies, and one of them hits a stack of crates - they&#39;re about to fall over and set off a bunch of noise!</i><br><br>Bund:  <b>holds out fate point</b>.  &quot;I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;m <b>A Whisper in the Night</b>, after all.  It looks like the body is going to hit the crate, but I stop just in time.  After that brief hiccup I get the bodies out of sight.&quot;<br><br>(Bund doesn&#39;t want to waste all of his work in making this quiet!  He pays a fate point and invokes his aspect <b>A Whisper in the Night</b> to ensure he moves the bodies quietly.  He chooses the +2 bonus, raising his +1 to +3 - enough to Overcome the default difficulty of Fair (+2)).<br><br><i>In the nick of time, Bund steadies the crates!  He breathes a sigh of relief, and pulls the bodies out of the way</i><br><br>GM:  <b>takes the fate point</b>  &quot;Yep.  Congrats, you managed to get past the mooks without raising an alarm.  Now, this door....&quot;<br><br><i>Bund stands before the locked steel door, ready for the next scene...</i></span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> -
