in the previous example (who would be likely closer to a +5 in the &quot;everyday people&quot; game).<br><br>And if you&#39;re running supers?  Superman is probably a +5, and a normal human being would be lucky to hit +1.<br><br>The beauty of this is that then all of the differences can be handled with narration, while the core math doesn&#39;t even get tweaked.  Which is a <b>great</b> thing - the core math works great, and modifications to it are inherently more risky than simply modifying your narration appropriately!<br><br>I&#39;ll admit, of course, that there are circumstances where this doesn&#39;t work.  If you want one skill to have a higher scene influence than another, for instance, or where you want the difference in capability between the peak and the base to be higher.  In practice, though, I think those circumstances are relatively rare, and should probably be the result of playtesting.  You just don&#39;t put a +5 skill vs. a +0 with any hope of success anyway.<br><br>Damage is another thing that can benefit from calibration.  The &quot;gritty&quot; question keeps coming up, and I see lots of number-based ways to handle grittiness.  And those can work, but may not be necessary.<br><br>Stress and consequences, to me, are about pacing and &quot;aftermath&quot;.  They&#39;re not about damage or realism or grittiness.  They&#39;re just about how long fights last, and what carries with you afterwards.<br><br>So let&#39;s say that with default Fate rules, you take a three stress hit from a sword.  You mark off your third stress box (moving you closer to being Taken Out) and narrate this as taking a nasty cut across the chest.<br><br>Now, we want to have a grittier game.  One where a nasty cut across the chest may well be fatal, and taking one probably means that you&#39;re pretty messed up.  So, we can do this by dropping the stress track to one, and making consequences only worth -1/-2/-3.  Now, that&#39;s a moderate consequence and your only stress box filled in!  Grittier!<br><br>It also makes fights shorter.  Which <b>may</b> be what you&#39;re going for, but isn&#39;t necessarily tied to grittiness.  A gritty fight might be two guys fighting each other for minutes, slowly wearing each other down, small nicks and bruises adding up as they desperately struggle.  That certainly <i>sounds</i> gritty, anyway.  And it&#39;s not necessarily short.<br><br>So, how do we model a gritty fight in Fate, <b>without</b> changing any of the dials?  Again, you could change dials as well, but I think it&#39;s interesting to see what happens if we <b>don&#39;t</b> change those dials.<br><br>Okay, so we take a three-stress hit.  What does this mean?  Well, mechanically, it means two things:  We&#39;re somewhat closer to being Taken Out, and there are no long lasting effects from this hit.<br><br>So if we&#39;re going for &quot;gritty&quot;, clearly this doesn&#39;t mean we took a nasty slice across the chest.  It could mean lots of things though.  Some things it might mean:<br><br>* We&#39;ve been forced out of position and are &quot;on our heels&quot;<br>* We&#39;ve taken a parry poorly, causing our hand to sting but no lasting damage<br>* We had to jump out of the way to dodge, causing no injury, but making us get a bit more winded.<br><br>But what would a nasty gash to the chest be, then?  Well, probably it would be Taken Out.  Pain, muscle damage, blood loss and shock would probably mean that a single serious blow means &quot;game over&quot;.<br><br>We can do the same thing with consequences.  What <b>does</b> a -2 consequence mean?<br><br>Well, mechanically, it means that the person that delivered it gets a free invoke, it will likely go away shortly after the fight, and that you&#39;re that much closer to being Taken Out.<br><br>What that means, narratively, has to match the feel of the game.  For a &quot;cinematic&quot; game, that may mean a cut to the arm, or something like that.  For a &quot;gritty&quot; game, it may simply mean that you&#39;ve lightly twisted an ankle, got a bit of &quot;dead arm&quot; from a hit that your armor soaked up, or the like.<br><br>&quot;But wait&quot;, you may be saying.  &quot;The descriptions of a lot of those don&#39;t sound like hits at all!&quot;<br><br>And?  The dice dictate the mechanical results of the action.  A &quot;hit&quot; or a &quot;miss&quot; is a narrative explanation of that mechanical effect.  The dice don&#39;t dictate narration - they just provide an end result that you narrate <b>to</b>.  &quot;Does three stress&quot; is a purely system-level statement.  How that translates into narrative is up to you - and should vary based on the type of feel you&#39;re going for.<br><br>What this ends up meaning is that, to create a grittier feel, you paradoxically narrate effects of hits as being <b>weaker</b>, not greater.  A three stress hit becomes getting knocked out of position.  A minor consequence is getting winded, or a minor laceration from shrapnel.  A severe consequence is a mild cut rather than a severe gash.  And being Taken Out means you suffered a single hard blow, not half a dozen!<br><br>Here&#39;s an example of how <b>the same fight</b> may play out in both &quot;cinematic&quot; and &quot;gritty&quot; style.  The same mechanical effects will be used in both situations!<br><br>Alfred hits Bob for three stress:  &quot;Alfed strikes at Bob, leaving a nasty cut across his chest.  Blood drips down as Bob begins his counterattack&quot;.<br><br>Bob hits Alfred for four stress, Alfred takes 2 and a minor consequence:  &quot;Bob&#39;s wicked counterattack catches Alfred off-guard, cutting him across the arm.  The cut looks deep, but Alfred&#39;s not out of the fight yet.&quot;<br><br>Alfred hits Bob for five stress, Bob takes a Severe consequence and one stress:  &quot;Alfred continues his furious assault at Bob, laying a nasty strike to the leg.  The cut doesn&#39;t look quite to the bone, but it&#39;s pretty severe&quot;.<br><br>... etc.  Compare to:<br><br>Alfred hits Bob for three stress:  &quot;Alfed strikes at Bob.  Bob&#39;s not ready for the sudden strike, so he stumbles and falls as he barely manages to parry in time.&quot;<br><br>Bob hits Alfred for four stress, Alfred takes 2 and a minor consequence:  &quot;Alfred presses too hastily, and Bob lashes up from his off-balance position.  Bob manages to get his blade down in time, but it looks like his hand is going to be sore from taken the impact poorly.&quot;<br><br>Alfred hits Bob for five stress, Bob takes a Severe consequence and one stress:  &quot;Nursing his injured hand, Alfred kicks at Bob and sprawls him out.  Bob gasps in pain, it feels like he may have a fractured rib.&quot;<br><br>Same mechanics.  Very different feel, based upon narration and calibration.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/112529978999668145491">Path</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112741983354868048321">Донато ди Никколо̀ ди Бетто Барди</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JuanmaBarranquero">Juanma Barranquero</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SophieLagace">Sophie Lagace</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KeenanScott">Keenan Scott</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114164514281927675482">Charles Nodell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MertTorun">Mert Torun</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116368885782787288189">gary mitchel</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AlexSchroeder">Alex Schroeder</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JonathanDietrich">Jonathan C.

For example Superman can lift a car without a roll as a trivial action, an oil tanker as a fair difficulty task, and prop up a collapsing skyscraper as a good difficulty task. You can then easily tweak the rungs of the ladder for a strong but not ridiculously strong character like Spider-Man, who might be able to lift a car as a Good action and a tanker truck as a Superb action and so forth.<br><br>The only thing to work out then is how best to &#39;balance&#39; characters so they have roughly the same number/levels of areas of super-competence to the extent that everyone feels happy with their character compared to the others.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-06-25T13:26:51-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/107657261121740797726" oid="107657261121740797726" >Scott Acker</a></span>:  Yup.  That&#39;s the point.  You also reset the +4 or +5, but I think that&#39;s somewhat implied.<br><br>Yeah, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/103306554028074451796" oid="103306554028074451796" >Richard Bellingham</a></span>  I think that&#39;s also what <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117033915544635907540" oid="117033915544635907540" >Ryan M.
