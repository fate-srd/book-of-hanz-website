Fate Points should be <b>dramatic</b>.  These are the times in the movie where we focus in on the hero, where he has the flashback to his family, where he thinks he&#39;s down but finds some inner reserve or pulls out a trick to overcome adversity anyway.  If you spend Fate Points like mad, you reduce their dramatic effect.  And that&#39;s <b>boring</b>.  It&#39;s fun, in a way, I guess.  Kind of like playing a first person shooter with all the cheats on, but it kinda robs the game of the full experience.<br><br>Now, there is a simple way I look at the Fate Point economy.  And I do use it as a tool to determine if I&quot;m throwing appropriate opposition against my players.<br><br>If a session ends, and they have a ton of FP, they should have lost ground in the narrative (and that&#39;s cool).<br><br>If a session ends, and they&#39;re dry of FP (and have even burned some stockpiled ones), then they should have gained good ground in the narrative.<br><br>If these things aren&#39;t true, then the difficulty of opposition I&#39;m throwing against the players is off, and needs to be adjusted.  That&#39;s about as deeply as I look into the &quot;Fate Point Economy&quot;.﻿</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> -

Handing them out for any somewhat entertaining contribution to the game leads to an (over)abundance of Fate points.<br><br>In Fate Core I find the flow of Fate points much slower, each and every spent and gained (by Compels or Concessions) Fate points has more &quot;weight&quot;.<br><br>I have played with GMs who were used to giving out Fate points quite often during a session. Playing Fate Core in such a game makes nearly every action a PC might attempt successful, makes it very hard for the GM to challenge the players, to offer decent &quot;resistance&quot; in the enfolding story, that the players can feel that they actually accomplished something against all the odds.<br><br>Fate Core puts more weight onto each Fate point and makes them a scarce resource, where you will get into the habit of accepting complications (succes with costs or simple failures), because these are, what makes any story more interesting.<br><br>For Fate experienced gamers, who are used to the stronger Fate point flow from other Fate dialects, Fate Core requires a change of habits.<br><br>But there is one thing that you actually lose by using the weak flow of Fate points in Fate Core: instant, haptic positive feedback. - Throwing a player, who contributes some entertaining bit to the game, a Fate points is an instant, non-verbal positive feedback, that helps to encourage player contribution. And that is one of the goals a stronger Fate point flow tries to achieve.<br><br>Arguably such a kind of feedback is not necessary. It helps getting some players to become more actively engaged in the game, though. - Not every player is a highly engaged, highly dramaturgy oriented, proactive, extroverted storyteller.<br><br>In my Fate Core games with new players (new to Fate Core, or even new to Pen&amp;Paper RPGs altogether) I sometimes missed this kind of encouraging haptic feedback.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+SophieLagace" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Sophie Lagace</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-15T12:25:03-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">All the plusses.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112190513987794169942" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brad Steffen</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-15T12:26:15-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">/sub</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/105660304254264836858" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Neil Ford</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-15T12:52:04-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">📌</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/106357304449163542146" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jesse Hudzik</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-15T12:52:44-0500</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2015-02-15T13:34:27-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I might be splitting hairs but a robust fate economy does not mean your players end up with &quot;buckets of points&quot; sitting in front them. That only happens if the flow goes one way. You can still get that feel of hard choices and have a robust chip economy. You just crank the relative difficulty up on everything.<br><br>I would only do this after clearing it with the players. I&#39;d say something along the lines that this game is going to have a more skin of your teeth feel and that you&#39;ll likely need to spend points for just about anything but the most mundane of challenges. In return you offer them plenty opportunities to earn points back through compels which in themselves can add to that challenge mentality.<br><br>My 2 cents anyway.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-15T13:47:29-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I knew I&#39;d ruffle someone&#39;s feathers :)<br><br>I think what&#39;s happening is that there&#39;s a disconnect in our goals in gaming.  I like gaming best when it&#39;s full of tension, hard choices, etc.  By your post, and the fact hat you think running a game like that requires talking with the players first, I&#39;d say those aren&#39;t the primary reasons you game.<br><br>And that&#39;s cool.<br><br>But spending a Fate Point or not just isn&#39;t an important decision when you know you&#39;re going to get a bunch more by the end of the scene or game.  There&#39;s little opportunity cost involved.  So, yeah, you can boost the opposition to counter handing out more Fate Points.  But that just means that you have to spend Fate Points in very scene, again, reducing the import of that decision.  It can become more about managing the &quot;flow&quot; of Fate Points, and that&#39;s just way too meta for me.  Sure, the Fate Points flying around can give everyone more chances to invoke and look awesome, but then again, at some level doesn&#39;t that mean that each of those points is less awesome in a way?<br><br>I mean, as far as differing expectations, I&#39;ll put it this way.  In almost every game I run, the PCs will &quot;lose&quot; at least one scene.  How often do your players &quot;lose&quot; scenes?  It&#39;s common in a lot of games for that to be uncommon, and I&#39;d hazard a guess that your games fall in that group.<br><br>Which again is okay.

If it&#39;s a single check, it&#39;s not that critical but if it&#39;s a contest or challenge, then it needs usually at least 3-4 checks against that same difficulty. Tension will rise. FP will burn thus you make sure players NEED to compel to get those needed FP in order to succeed.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112236017611575207167" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Christopher Stilson</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-17T10:58:01-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">If it weren&#39;t for the fact that I like my nice shiny metal fate point counters, I&#39;d drop points from the game entirely and use free invocations and success-at-cost mechanics as the only methods of buying success.<br><br>Actually, something that I think ought to be mentioned as a dial is when to keep point use low and when to go gonzo - for instance, sword-and-sorcery or horror games benefit from making just one point feel significant, whereas a shounen fighting game should ideally involve furious bidding wars (possibly on every exchange).</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+GaryFurash" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Gary Furash</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-02-17T11:15:01-0500</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2015-02-17T11:15:12-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I&#39;ve noticed this general problem with any game that uses a benny like mechanic.
