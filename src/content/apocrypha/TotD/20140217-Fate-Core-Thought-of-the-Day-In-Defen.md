On the surface level it is just a piece of fun that seems unrelated. Look a bit deeper and it is a chance for the characters to demonstrate a new character trait or emphasize an existing trait. And on a third level it should reinforce the main plot. It should never be a tangent from the overall theme. It should reinforce the themes or bring the characters back around to the extant themes. It is basically either an echo of the main story, or an arrow back to the main story.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+StuartMcDermid" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Stuart McDermid</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-02-18T04:18:58-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Totally.

Good characters make a story better, but I hold a story can be good on its own with only average characters. It is dependant on what style of stories you are dealing with. Most legends and myths have fairly dull characters, yet the stories are timeless. You could argue that tolkien wrote some fairly boring main characters yet the story is good. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+StuartMcDermid" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Stuart McDermid</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-02-18T16:33:20-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">A good world builder does not a good storyteller make. <br><br>I&#39;ve played games with quite a few GMs who are quite good at plotting things out and drawing maps and all that type of admin-type stuff. <br><br>Their inability to breathe life into their characters and/or create situations so that the players could do the same meant that their games were lifeless and dull.<br><br>I find games without hard moral choices and we&#39;ll acted characters boring. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/117399224993676152730" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jiyang Li</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-02-18T17:56:22-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/110682395387731432977" oid="110682395387731432977" >Jacob Poss</a></span> It really depends upon the form and the medium of the story.
