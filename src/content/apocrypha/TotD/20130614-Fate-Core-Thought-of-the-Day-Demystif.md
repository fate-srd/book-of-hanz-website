Wrong Wrongenstein.<br><br>This was just one of my first errors in understanding Fate, but it&#39;s a pretty significant one.  I was thinking of an aspect as primarily something that gave a bonus, and something that was attached to something else, like an adjective.  And you can make an argument that some aspects are like that, but it&#39;s really not a very good understanding.  An aspect is both simpler, and more complex than that.<br><br>An aspect, really, is a story element.  It is something, anything, that is important to the story in some way.  It&#39;s an &#39;aspect&#39; of the story, if you will.<br><br>At it&#39;s most simple, it&#39;s something that the story is about.<br><br>I&#39;m going to go back to &#39;narrative first&#39; here.  We need to understand what is important to the story (at least at this point, this scene), and then we capture those things, stick little labels on them, and call them &#39;aspects&#39;.<br><br>But what about characters, you may ask.  They&#39;re important to the story, clearly!  And they&#39;re characters, not aspects!<br><br>Ah-ha!  You have fallen into my trap, oh non-existent-person-that-I-put-words-in-the-mouth-of!  You&#39;re assuming that characters aren&#39;t aspects, but they clearly are!<br><br>Well, then how come characters have skills, and aspects don&#39;t?  I mean, clearly <i>Pitch Darkness</i> can&#39;t drive a car!<br><br>And here, perhaps, there&#39;s some presumptions made about what a &#39;skill&#39; is.  A &#39;skill&#39; doesn&#39;t represent training.  It represents the ability of a story &#39;aspect&#39; to influence a scene, without being invoked by someone else.<br><br>Okay, that sounds like a bunch of crazy meta-talk, so let&#39;s try and get back to English.<br><br>A character is a story element.  It can influence a scene.  It does so by using skills.  What a skill represents, then, is the ability for an story element to influence a scene, without the influence of another.<br><br>So, what about <i>Pitch Darkness</i>?  It certainly can&#39;t drive!  This is true, which is why it won&#39;t have the Drive skill.  But, depending on the game and scene, it <b>can</b> influence things!  Darkness can make people paranoid, it can cause them mental stress.  Instead of having a bunch of rules for all of these things, Fate just handles it by saying &#39;Sure, <i>Pitch Darkness</i> can be active and influence a scene if appropriate.  Just give it skills&#39;.<br><br>And this is one of the fundamental points of the fractal - that story elements can influence scenes, and they do those using &#39;skills&#39;.<br><br>A character isn&#39;t really any different than <i>Pitch Darkness</i>.  It&#39;s just easier to lump up some commonalities of story elements controlled by players, and call it a &#39;character&#39; by convention.<br><br>And story elements can have other story elements.  The <del>character</del> story element Han Solo is associated with <i>The Millennium Falcon</i>.  It&#39;s easy to call the Falcon a &#39;detail&#39; of Han Solo since, if he wasn&#39;t in the story, the Falcon wouldn&#39;t be either.  So we declare <i>The Millennium Falcon</i> to be an &#39;aspect&#39; of Han Solo (who is, himself, an aspect - a story element).  And, of course, the Falcon can have its own skills, and its own aspects (<i>Hidden Storage Everywhere</i>, for instance).<br><br>And that&#39;s a pretty good description of the Fractal.  But there&#39;s one piece that&#39;s missing.  A fundamental feature of fractals, in math, is that they have infinite detail.  You can zoom out of them, view them at a larger scale, or zoom into them, and see them at a tighter scale, and they still have equivalent detail.  That&#39;s pretty cool.  And it&#39;s pretty important to understanding the Fate Fractal, as well.<br><br>Let&#39;s say we&#39;re playing some fantasy game, and there&#39;s the setting aspect <i>The City State of Warrington</i>.  It&#39;s relevant to the story, so it&#39;s an aspect, and as such can be invoked or compelled.<br><br>Now, later on, our protagonists get closer to Warrington, and so it becomes more relevant to the story.  We can start giving it aspects of its own, such as <i>Rules With An Iron Fist</i>, <i>Constantly Guarded</i>, and <i>Bloodthirsty Militia</i>.  We can give it skills, like Conquer Other City-States:4.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s say that our protagonists get closer to the city.  The city is constantly guarded, but we want some more detail, so we can declare a <i>Gate Guards</i> aspect.  If the protagonists maintain their distance, an aspect, by itself, is probably sufficient to indicate their effect on the scene.<br><br>But if we get closer, we might want to have some more detail there, again.  Maybe we decide that there&#39;s a <i>Fat Guard</i> and a <i>Skinny Guard</i>.  As we get closer, maybe they get some aspects of their own.  And certainly, if we storm the gates, they&#39;ll need skills, and possibly equipment, and so on!  And even their equipment could get aspects - if a PC uses Create Advantage to declare that the Skinny Guard&#39;s sword is old and brittle, then so it is!<br><br>This is, fundamentally, what the Fate Fractal is really about.  It&#39;s about having a universal way of describing story elements, and their ability to impact the world.  It&#39;s about having the ability to describe these elements <b>with the right amount of detail for the current scene</b>.  I don&#39;t need to know specifics about the two guards if I&#39;m a hundred miles from Warrington.  I need to know that it exists, and that it&#39;s oppressive.<br><br>But as I get closer, its ability to manipulate things becomes important.  I need to know more about how it impacts the scenes characters are in.  So the Fate Fractal gives me tools to flesh this out.  Even the guards go from being a generalized aspect (<i>Gate Guards</i>), to individuals, to individual elements containing skills, and possibly even sub-elements.<br><br>And none of this changes a single thing about them, at any point.  The guards don&#39;t suddenly &#39;gain skills&#39; when I get close to them.  They always had them.  It&#39;s just that they weren&#39;t actually important until we were in a position to interact with them.  They didn&#39;t &#39;change&#39; from &#39;aspects&#39; to &#39;characters&#39; - that&#39;s a false distinction.  They were <b>always</b> aspects, in that every story element is an aspect!  And they were always &#39;characters&#39;, because what else could a guard be?  But as we needed to know more about them, we detailed them out further, and when we didn&#39;t need that detail, we didn&#39;t have to think about it.  The city-state of Warrington didn&#39;t become a fractal aspect when we needed more detail - it&#39;s still &#39;an aspect&#39;, just one with less detail associated with it.  Nothing about its fundamental nature changed.<br><br>So if you have an aspect that needs to be active in a scene, just give it a skill!  There&#39;s no change in &#39;type&#39; that needs to occur.  &#39;Skills&#39; is just how story elements impact scenes, without being driven by another story element.<br><br>It&#39;s all just aspects.  All the way down.<br><br>Until you reach the turtles.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/102131538614257433792">Döktor Jibe</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101947999336698012481">Wickus Booyse</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117646243340764868749">Nathan Roberts</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108002687308961575436">Matías Ignacio López Veluscek (codingTornado)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NeillRobson">Neill Robson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114759877602027690129">Roman Chang</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LorenNorman">Loren Norman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MertTorun">Mert Torun</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108287480576898126045">Jon Tate</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114026319786381021724">Angela Robertson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MikeLindsey">Mike Lindsey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111937671651246346867">Antaeus Feldspar</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SophieLagace">Sophie Lagace</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110894725664630335130">BE Knoll</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KeenanScott">Keenan Scott</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimNoyce">Tim Noyce</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105675834591618577037">Niall Maguire</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108798034929900724875">Shawn Givens</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114164514281927675482">Charles Nodell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GaryFurash">Gary Furash</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SterlingHeibeck">Sterling Heibeck</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114849231483871582524">Hollis McCray</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114652342925236439977">Manuel Paccagnella</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112666772707538205459">Ville Makkonen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChuckDurfee">Chuck Durfee</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111190775172715019276">Joshua Coquat</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LarsEmilSilvstål">Lars-Emil Silvstål</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104892928505684381674">Mike Thompson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+OliverGraf">Oliver Graf</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109445681594405797785">David Silberstein</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MookWilson">Mook Wilson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TomTysonbluetyson">Blue Tyson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104767143761290499729">Rob Thornton</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114271078132687773666">Sam O&#39;Reilly</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton">Wil Hutton</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103769944042506129197">Heimdallsgothi (Heimdallsgothi)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104778703342814527599">Gerald Rose</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114499247694855981536">Emmanuel Kanter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+StefanSchloesser">Stefan Schloesser (Shadom)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576">Paul Kießhauer</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115711696622008950601">Javier Dorta</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NobilisReed">Nobilis Reed</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/108002687308961575436">Matías Ignacio López Veluscek (codingTornado)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117311957598322653175">Keith Lau</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JohannesOppermann">Johannes Oppermann</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108287480576898126045">Jon Tate</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114849231483871582524">Hollis McCray</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamLerner">Ada Lerner</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111190775172715019276">Joshua Coquat</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton">Wil Hutton</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TJKing">T.J.

Realising that they <b>are</b> aspects, transmogrified by alchemy, explains why I&#39;ve always had a hard time separating them!<br><br>Realising they&#39;re so closely related makes me much less worried about getting the distinction <b>right</b>, which lets me get past that and get on with thinking about which would best serve the desired narrative function.</div></div></div></body></html>
