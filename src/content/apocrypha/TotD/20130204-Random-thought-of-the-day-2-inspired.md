Some would say the &quot;Choosing to sac what you value least is bad roleplay&quot; but it&#39;s really not. It&#39;s actually the logical thing to do. Any player can justify it with, &quot;What would my character do?&quot; Which the answer will almost always be &quot;Sac what I value least.&quot; The problem is stopping metagaming where the player can see the scope of the choices but the character they&#39;re playing can&#39;t.<br><br>My answer to this when I&#39;ve dm&#39;d in the past has always been to give red herrings early on so the players have a hard time telling what the effects of their actions will be (eliminating the meta and forcing them to just roleplay) and then to also reward the player for making the hard choices if it stays with the character (works really well in Fate.
