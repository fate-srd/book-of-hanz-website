<a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz/posts/2hHTAEucYRW"><span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-06-12T13:37:08-0400</span></a><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2013-06-12T15:39:51-0400</span></span></div><div class="main-content"><span itemprop="text">Fate Core Thought of the Day:  The Joy of Create Advantage<br><br>While most of my posts are probably GM-centric, this one&#39;s a lot more player-centric.  Hey, gotta change it up, right?<br><br>One of the things that I see with players new to Fate is that they overly-rely on the Attack action in conflicts.  My experience has shown that, in many cases, Attack is actually the least effective option, when viewed from an overall perspective.  Sure, you can&#39;t Create Advantage someone to death (or to Taken Out, as the case may be), but CA has a lot of advantages over Attack overall, and especially as a lead-up to an actual damaging attack.<br><br>To most vets, this stuff will be obvious, so I apologize for that... but these might be good points to raise with your players, especially if they&#39;re having issues, or over-relying on Attack actions.<br><br>Here&#39;s a few of the main reasons why Create Advantage should be the majority of the players&#39; actions in a Conflict:<br><br><b>1) It&#39;s more efficient.</b><br><br>Both Attack and Create Advantage give you the opportunity to buy shifts of effect.  For Create Advantage, these shifts (via free invocations) are delayed, but for a given success threshold, you&#39;ll actually get <b>more</b> shifts of effect than Attack for the vast majority of cases...<br><br>Margin of success    Create Advantage shifts  Attack shifts<br>0                                   2 (boost)                             2 (boost)<br>1                                   2                                           1<br>2                                   2                                           2<br>3                                   4 (two free invokes)          3<br>4                                   4                                           4<br><br>Admittedly, after a margin of success of four, Attack starts to win out - but you generally won&#39;t see that margin of success unless you&#39;ve got a number of free invokes to boost you there, or burn a bunch of fate points!<br><br><b>2) Create Advantage is flexible.</b><br><br>Attack does one thing - it causes stress and consequences to your opponent.  However, the shifts of effect (free invokes) created by Create Advantage can, depending on the advantage, be used for Attack <b>or</b> Defense!  And they also have the potential of being used by other members of your group.  Or they can be used with an Attack to do straight damage.  Create Advantage creates <b>options</b>.<br><br><b>3) Create Advantage lets you choose the skill match-up</b><br><br>In conflicts, and especially with an Attack, absolute skill levels are irrelevant.  What&#39;s important is the <b>relative</b> skill level between you and your opponent.  And one of the main &#39;strategy&#39; bits in Fate is figuring out, narratively, how to maximize that difference in your favor.<br><br>Using your &#39;best&#39; skill isn&#39;t always the best idea.  If you&#39;ve got Fight of 4, and you&#39;re facing an opponent with Fight 6, you&#39;re at a permanent disadvantage.  And it&#39;s usually pretty hard to justify why you&#39;re using another skill for Attack, or why Fight can&#39;t be used to defend (substitute Shoot/Athletics as appropriate).<br><br>But Create Advantage lets you get around this.  So long as the action you create justifies it, it allows <b>you</b> to set up the skill matchup.  So if you&#39;ve got Fight 4, and the bad guy has Fight 6?  No problem... maybe you&#39;ve got Intimidate 4, and he&#39;s got a Will of only 1!  Scare him with that!  Or use your athletics skill to set up a favorable position, perhaps challenged by his Notice skill.<br><br>Once you&#39;ve internalized this, the big bruiser just looks like a big opportunity, since you know he probably has some pretty weak social skills just waiting to be exploited.  (Strangely, against a superior combatant, it&#39;s often the combat-focused characters that are the <b>least</b> effective, as they have fewer good skill matchups).<br><br>Of course, an especially ninja trick is to use Create Advantage actions that are resisted by the environment, rather than the enemy - these are <b>very</b> likely to be easier to accomplish than something with passive resistance!<br><br><b>4) Create Advantage lets you set up huge hits</b><br><br>While it&#39;s not <i>always</i> the case, in Fate it&#39;s often true that a single big hit is worth more than two little ones.  If you&#39;ve got three stress, a pair of two-stress hits will just mark off your second and third stress boxes - but a single four-stress hit will force you to take a Consequence.<br><br>In general, bigger hits will take down enemies quicker, while smaller hits will be more efficient (require fewer overall successes) at the expense of taking more actual attacks to<br>accomplish.<br><br>And what&#39;s the easiest way to set up a big hit?  Either burn through your Fate Point supply or... set up a bunch of free invocations of aspects via Create Advantage.  You know what happens to bad guys if your whole team concentrates for a round or two on Creating Advantages, and then passes all of those free invocations to your most competent combatant?  <b>Pain</b>. <br><br>Combine this with the higher efficiency and preferred skill-matchup of Create Advantage, and you have a recipe for Taking Out even the nastiest, ugliest enemy you encounter (or, the most attractive, suave enemy if it&#39;s a social conflict!)<br><br><b>5) The Narrative Truth of Aspects</b><br><br>So far, I&#39;ve just talked about the purely mechanical, math-based benefits of Create Advantage.  But that&#39;s only part of the story.<br><br>In addition to all of the other advantages listed above, Create Advantage <b>creates narrative truth</b>.  If you get your opponent <i>Cowering in Fear</i>, then he&#39;s doing that.  Which should restrict his actions.<br><br>Aspects can do all sorts of things, from action permission to denial, to setting up difficulties where none existed, to granting permission for active interference. <br><br>They knock people on the ground, disarm them, have them wandering about in a fog.<br><br>And this is all <b>on top of</b> the mechanical benefits.  Beautiful, I tell you!<br><br>So, anyway, I hope this helps in some way.  It&#39;s based on my observation of new Fate players, and is basically a rundown of the points I make with them to get them out of the &quot;Attack Attack Attack&quot; cycle, and thinking more &quot;like Fate&quot;, which often gets them into describing narrative goodness and all the other coolness I&#39;ve come to associate with Fate.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> -

It&#39;s definitely something worth mentioning to players, I find--get the situation right, and anything can Attack. But, yes, I&#39;d totally want to treat the push off the cliff, if it&#39;s designed to Take Out, as an Attack (even if Physique or Athletics was being used); it&#39;s the situation that justifies it.<br><br>It might be worth spelling that out as part of the &quot;action permission&quot; clause above. I think lots of people get worried that skill X isn&#39;t an attack skill, so it can&#39;t be used in Y situation. But Create Advantage is the go-to for justifying why, all of a sudden, Lore or Crafts or Will is being used to attack.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamDrew" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Adam “Bison Court” D</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-06-12T15:48:01-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2013-06-12T15:48:42-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Oh, a possible expansion of 5: it might come up when the fiction has established that attack actions are impossible in the circumstances. Eg: in a <i>Dune</i> or <i>Fading Suns</i> game, anybody with an aspect that suggests they have a shield is protected from slugthrower fire, and shooting them with a laser obliterates the shooter and the target. Attack actions are probably not an option unless you want to close to duelling range. But you can still create advantages with your laser all day, by collapsing roofs, sealing doors, destroying important tech, etc. ﻿</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobDonoghue" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rob Donoghue</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-06-12T15:50:29-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">In fact, that muddiness is exactly why I kind of dig the &quot;no attack&quot; model  But I largely find that it&#39;s something which the fiction can <b>usually</b> make clear, if everyone is on the same page regarding what an attack really is (and the trick is that, really, an attack is a pacing mechanism).<br><br>The complications I&#39;ve run into with going &quot;No Attack&quot; is that it speed sup combat more than people like, and it can result in a bit less back and forth than desired.  There are fixes for this (some specific rules for consequence aspects and taking people out go a long way) but that does introduce extra (sometimes unwelcome) complexity.  So, it&#39;s still something to sort out.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112666772707538205459" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ville Makkonen</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-06-14T00:52:45-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">/sub</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+SterlingHeibeck" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Sterling Heibeck</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-07-30T17:20:18-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">This is a great article exposing the beauty that is Create Advantage.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116146163870101446907" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Scott Puckett</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-07-28T16:16:34-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">/subscribe</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherLorandoMD" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Christopher Lorando</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-10-09T16:19:52-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Your detail on the way to use advantages/aspect is a resource was a true gem that I found while lurking various forums/websites.
