track:click" dir="ltr">Spinal Tap - 11</a>)<br><br>Okay, so I may have over or mis-sold this one.  This is really a second thought that I think informs and supports the previous in a way that it&#39;s kind of hard for me to talk about one without briefly mentioning the other, and vice versa.<br><br>I&#39;m going to do a little setup on this one, as I think you need to understand how I view skills to get the point I&#39;m trying to make here.  As always, this is just Rob&#39;s Humble Opinion and obviously ain&#39;t anything official.  I work for a little software company in the Northwest, not a huge gaming conglomerate in San Francisco!<br><br>So let&#39;s talk about skills.  Skills are how good you are at something, right?  I mean, that&#39;s what it says on the tin.<br><br>That&#39;s true in most games, and is superficially true in Fate.  But I don&#39;t really look at skills as &quot;skills&quot; in Fate, because, hey, Physique isn&#39;t a &quot;skill&quot;.  What I look at skills as is closer to &quot;how a character impacts the scene&quot;.  This makes a lot of things make more sense.  If you think about someone with a gun versus a martial artist, realistically, the martial artist will be less effective given the same skill.<br><br>But, if we just say that the skill represents your ability to influence the scene, then we can kind of roll the influence of the weapon into the influence of the skill and call it a day.  So with a hypothetical Martial Arts skill of 4, you&#39;d be Jackie Chan, but with a Shoot of 4, you&#39;d be pretty competent, as your weapon itself would be part of that scene influence.<br><br>I&#39;m getting somewhere with this, really!  Thanks for reading so far!<br><br>In the previous post, I talked about modeling a cybernetic arm primarily by just giving the character the appropriate skill (Physique or possibly Athletics), an Aspect for the more narrative bits, and maybe possibly a stunt, and calling it a day.  This works because, to me, having that 4 in Physique says &quot;I have this much influence in scenes, when I approach them in this way.  *How* I got that influence is irrelevant, whether it&#39;s working out, technology, magic, or whatever.&quot;<br><br>At this point, you might ask &quot;what if I was a body builder that had cybernetics installed, hrm, Mr. Smarty Pants?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fate Doesn&#39;t Go To Eleven.&quot;<br><br>Okay, I finally got around to the post title.  But what the hell do I mean by that?  If you&#39;re not familiar with the phrase &quot;goes to eleven,&quot; it comes from the movie <i>This Is Spinäl Tap</i>.  In it, one of the guitarists talks about his amps being special because while most amps have ten as the highest setting on the dial, his goes to eleven.  Apparently he&#39;s too dumb to realize that it&#39;s the internals of the system that determine the volume of the amp, and that the label is exactly that, just a label.<br><br>Fate does not go to eleven.  If the maximum skill you can have in an area is +4, then that&#39;s what you get.  That also represents the maximum ability that a starting character can have in that area.  Period.  (Okay, there&#39;s stunts, too, but there shouldn&#39;t be anything granting a flat bonus).  +4 doesn&#39;t need to represent the same thing in every game.  It represents the maximum that a player can start with, in that game.  +4 Physique could be the strongest a human can achieve in one game, and it could be Superman in another.  It&#39;s a scale, a way of calibrating.  It&#39;s not GURPS, where 15 STR means exactly what 15 STR means, and you have lots of tables telling you exactly what 15 STR does, and you have to have crazy high levels of strength to represent augmented individuals, or supers, or whatever.<br><br>Now I&#39;m going to tie back to <i>Just Do It</i> again.  One of the reasons that people like toolboxes is that they like going to eleven.  They like hearing about the maximum value of something, and then finding a way to surpass it.  &quot;How high can we stack the bonuses?&quot;  Many folks will want to make a character with a cybernetic arm not because they think it makes a great story, but because they think that it will allow them to go higher than the supposed highest in the system - it lets them go to eleven.  Which, of course, means that the &quot;highest&quot; in fact wasn&#39;t, and the real &quot;highest&quot; is totally dependent on how high you can stack your Lego blocks.<br><br>Fate doesn&#39;t do that.  Fate just says, &quot;You can have +4.  And a few stunts to let you do a bit better in specific situations.  You can&#39;t have more.  Have a nice day.&quot;  Fate just says your amp goes to 10, and if you want to be louder, you need a louder amp - aka, play in a setting where +4 means something else.  It doesn&#39;t lie to you and just relabel the loudest as 11 so that you feel more awesome.  It&#39;s honest in its calibrations and ranges.<br><br>Some people, of course, do love that type of charop.  I personally have litlte use for it, and I suspect some people agree with me.  And thankfully there&#39;s tons of games in the hobby, and <b>lots</b> of them support that level of charop.  If I want a game that does that, then I&#39;ll play that type of game.<br><br>I&#39;m just glad that Fate doesn&#39;t do that, and that it gives me an option that doesn&#39;t go to eleven.</span></div><span itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY" target="_blank" class="media-link" itemprop="url"><div class="video-placeholder" title="Clip from the movie spinal tap where they talk about the amps that go to 11.."><span class="play-icon"></span></div><p>Clip from the movie spinal tap where they talk about the amps that go to 11..</p></a></span></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AlessandroPiroddi">Alessandro Piroddi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RRClark">R R Clark</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Finitumus">Finitumus</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KeithClendenen">Keith Clendenen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116368617254549940475">Mark Kowalizzinn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112472792071464087948">Jessica Stormshadow</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherRuthenbeck">Christopher Ruthenbeck</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111506991088965328628">Torben Hagesø</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimNoyce">Tim Noyce</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106330449793744263319">Michael Bowman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DirkWillrodtGaronenur">Dirk Willrodt</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102028043451579303277">J Woosley</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilleBackman">Wille Backman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JohnMoley">John Moley</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105912177797448389192">Christopher Dyszelski</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112536115051160493758">Jonathan Carr</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113431852992879601122">Joseph Moore</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LesSimpsonNeonRoosterTransmissions">Les Simpson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamDrew">Adam “Bison Court” D</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JoshLeavitt">Josh Leavitt (Locke)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JackGulick">Jack Gulick</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimFranzke">T.

You don&#39;t get to go to 11.<br><br>The example deliberately skimmed over the topic of stunts and aspects for a few reasons:<br><br>1) To simplify things a bit.<br>2) Because everyone has access to stunts and aspects.<br><br>Universal access to stunts and aspects means that essentially, everyone is on the same footing.  If you want to be &quot;really strong&quot;, you&#39;re going to take Physique at +4.  You&#39;re going to take an aspect or two related to your strength (<i>Strongman</i> works just as well as <i>Cybernetic Arm</i>), and you&#39;re probably going to take a stunt or two allowing you to use your strength in some interesting way.<br><br>Which is great.  And everyone can do that.  And you can be just as effective in describing why you&#39;re so strong as just having trained a lot as you can by having a cybernetic arm.  The limits the system puts on you, in terms of stunts, aspects, skill levels, and fate point economy, are the limits.  They&#39;re there, and they&#39;re really not intended to be circumvented.  This is a <b>very</b> different view than many games, where stacking bonuses is a fully intentional part of the game.<br><br>So if your point is that someone with +4 Physique, an aspect or two related to strength, and a few strength-related stunts is more effective in strengthiness than someone with just a +4 Physique, I totally agree with you.  But I don&#39;t agree that the game is really about going <b>past</b> those inherent limitations in the system.  If you want to be Superman, you don&#39;t find a way to get a +8 strength - you just say that +4 means Superman, and get on with the game.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JackGulick" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jack Gulick</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-25T18:11:00-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Let&#39;s imagine a character.<br><br>He has Shoot +4.<br><br>Can you compel him to pull a gun on someone who&#39;s upset him because he&#39;s good with a gun?<br><br>I say no.<br><br>Because he might be (to quote a wise man on the subject) The Shepherd and he might be The Tyranny Of Evil Men.<br><br>And you just don&#39;t know that from his skill choice.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-25T18:14:01-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I was actually going to use an example of an Investigation - can you use that to compel?  Not in my thinking - the character could be a bounty hunter that&#39;s just very, very good at his job, and could give a crap about anything else.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+ManfredGabriel" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Manfred Gabriel</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-25T18:31:09-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/114357509183316569561" oid="114357509183316569561" >Jack Gulick</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> this is interesting because I just gave that example in the other post about the fractal. <br><br>May answer is, yes: I would compel a character to pull a gun on someone who&#39;s upset him because he&#39;s good with a gun. BUT this assumes that I don&#39;t have other aspects to work with. If the character has relevant aspects, like The Shepherd or The Tyranny Of Evil Men, of if his high concept is Dog in the Vineyard - then that aspect takes precedence naturally. But if everything else is neutral in this situation, so that what we have to work with is the apex skill choices the character made, then I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to compel the apex skill. It says who the character is. If you only have a hammer, every problem is a nail. <br><br>Remember the movie Shane? He was a character with apex skill guns, and the whole movie is about how that defines him. He wants to get away from being man with a gun but he can&#39;t because it&#39;s who he is.

I have limited play experience with Core, and  it has not been a problem. Keeping the characters consistently and even-handedly compelled has been, and I&#39;ve tried to figure out something to simplify that. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-25T18:43:14-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2013-03-25T19:27:33-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I think we&#39;re going to have to agree to disagree, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102403887926849544910" oid="102403887926849544910" >Manfred Gabriel</a></span>.  I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t really think that it&#39;s &quot;not spelled out,&quot; as you say, but rather it&#39;s just not there.  I don&#39;t see anything anywhere in any rule that says that skills or stunts can be invoked or compelled.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean badwrongfun, of course, just that it&#39;s more of a house rule.<br><br>In reality, most characters will have a High Concept that in some way reflects their skill loadout, so this is probably a non-issue, realistically.<br><br>For Shane, I think that he&#39;d have an aspect reflecting that part of his character - likely his Trouble.  So I think the existing mechanics work perfectly great for that, and that there&#39;s no need to make a statement that skills are in fact aspects - which has all sorts of questions as well, like at what level does the skill have to be there to be usable as an aspect, anyway?<br><br>&quot;But if everything else is neutral in this situation, so that what we have to work with is the apex skill choices the character made, then I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to compel the apex skill.&quot;  This is kind of strange to me.  Compels aren&#39;t about driving the play the direction you want it to go - they&#39;re about driving the story the way that the players decide they want it to go, via their aspects.  If someone doesn&#39;t have an appropriate aspect, then they haven&#39;t told you they want a certain thing to be part of their character&#39;s story... so why go there?  I find that most compels I offer are taken - not because of any mechanical issue, but because I&#39;m in tune (via the communication of aspects) with how the player wants their story to go.  I&#39;m hesitant to break that by compelling on things that aren&#39;t put forward as aspects.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+ManfredGabriel" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Manfred Gabriel</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-25T23:50:33-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> - I don&#39;t want to flog this to death, and I freely admit that compelling apex skills isn&#39;t a mechanic provided in the rules. You say: <i>&quot;Compels aren&#39;t about driving the play the direction you want it to go - they&#39;re about driving the story the way that the players decide they want it to go, via their aspects.  If someone doesn&#39;t have an appropriate aspect, then they haven&#39;t told you they want a certain thing to be part of their character&#39;s story... so why go there?&quot;</i> --- and I guess my point is precisely that the player has told me something meaningful about their character by choosing their particular apex skills.

So, in that respect, again, the 1-8 can be pretty limiting.<br>Problem 3 - Long games or games with fast character advancement. If you make advancement happen faster and play for long enough, eventually you end up with very high skills.  You could agitate for &#39;rescaling&#39; but that&#39;s not going to <i>feel</i> right because of the dice mechanics, nor would toning down the rate of advancement by toning up the narrative.<br><br>However, this isn&#39;t a problem unique to Fate.  D20 (and most other games) also scale to 2x the dice range.  I think 2x dice range is actually a mistake, but it&#39;s an entirely forgivable one given the other things Fate does well.<br>So, I actually agree that &quot;Fate doesn&#39;t go to 11&quot;, with the exception of &quot;Unless you really need it to, and then it offers that possibility&quot;.  However, the &quot;unless you need it to&quot; is not like the situations you mentioned above.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+MārtiņšLīvens" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Mārtiņš Līvens</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-04T04:25:10-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Skill rating as matter of influence on the scene reminded me &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and it&#39;s stat descriptions.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+AndrewDacey" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Andrew Dacey</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-04T06:19:40-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I think baselining makes sense for a lot of games. You mentioned GURPS, before so I thought I&#39;d relate an example from a campaign I played in. Yes, GURPS defines your stats absolutely, but it doesn&#39;t really weigh in the same way with advantages and disadvantages. There&#39;s the concept that if a disadvantage isn&#39;t really a disadvantage then you can&#39;t take it. For example, being illiterate in a campaign setting with no writing wouldn&#39;t be a disadvantage. Flipping this around, a disadvantage (or advantage for that matter) that everyone in the world has isn&#39;t really a disadvantage, it&#39;s meant to be what makes your particular character disadvantaged compared to the rest of the people in the world.<br><br>Now let&#39;s look at the specific example. We were playing in a zombie apocalypse world as part of a military reclamation effort. Logically, you could make the case that extremely hazardous duty would be a valid disadvantage to take. But, every character in the group, and just about every non-zombie NPC was part of the same military structure; it was just the nature of the world. It doesn&#39;t make sense for every PC to tie up a good chunk of their allotted disadvantages for something that everyone has and can&#39;t opt out of.<br><br>Similarly for the military rank advantage. We were all members of the military so it really didn&#39;t make sense for all of the lowest ranking PCs to take the lowest military rank advantage. All that really mattered was our relative rank to each other, so we baselined things to be that everyone was in the military and only members who were higher rank had to take the advantage, so that they could outrank other people.<br><br>I know I&#39;ve rambled on for ages about GURPS rather than Fate but I wanted to show how the baselining concept can apply in a broader way for any generic system.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T14:13:23-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Absolutely, and that&#39;s even the advice in GURPS, right?  Only one of Literacy/Illiteracy is even <b>available</b>, based on the overall literacy status of the campaign.<br><br>You can also handle a lot of that baselining in GURPS by handing out extra points to get up to the baseline, etc., and increase the disad pool as appropriate.  But that&#39;s going even further into GURPS discussion, which probably isn&#39;t too appropriate here. <br><br>But yeah, baselining is a pretty useful concept in just about any game.  In a 4e game I helped run, we put out level equivalents to real world analogies to help people get a feel for where they placed in the world and to set expectations.<br><br>I still think that Fate is relatively unique in that <b>everything</b> is relative, and that there are <b>no</b> fixed points.  At least, I&#39;m not aware of any other system where a particular strength or strength equivalent doesn&#39;t directly inform a carrying capacity type stat.<br><br>At any rate, this particular article isn&#39;t really about baselining so much as it is about the lack of permanent static bonuses.  But there is another article I wrote about baselining :)<br><br>To make that more clear, using GURPS as an example, your <b>baseline</b> (that is, non-situational) ability to be effective in a fight is dependent on a number of things - your skill, your strength, the weapon you&#39;re using, your armor, any advantages and disadvantages you have, etc.<br><br>In Fate, it&#39;s based on your Fight score.  Stunts can provide <b>situational</b> advantages, but they&#39;re explicitly shouldn&#39;t be applicable to every roll of the dice.<br><br>This makes it really easy to do things.  If you want to be a good fighter, buy Fight 4.  *Why* you&#39;re a good fighter is up to you, whether you&#39;re really strong, or super-fast, or just really skilled.  On a system-level, it&#39;s irrelevant.<br><br>&quot;Tricky&quot; builds in other systems also become incredibly simple to make.  Wanna make Zatoichi?  Take a &quot;blind&quot; aspect, and Fight 4.  Done.  No messing around with a blind disadvantage that has certain penalties, and then a Blind Fighting advantage to counter-act those, etc...<br><br>Of course, this also works because Fate doesn&#39;t put a ton of emphasis on the tactical combat portion of the game, so the amount of differentiation in that aspect of the game is a lot, lot less.</div></div></div></body></html>
