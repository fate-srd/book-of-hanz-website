 Great!  One&#39;s clearly the good guys, and one&#39;s clearly bad... well, you&#39;ve just removed a decision, in that (hopefully!) the players will align with the good guys.  Instead, try to make the two sides have implications for the future of the town that aren&#39;t just &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; - or even better yet, tie them into character aspects, especially if you can find conflicting aspects!<br><br>Same with game mechanics.  Got some funky new dice mechanic you want to try?  Awesome!  But what decision points does it give to the players that they don&#39;t have?  If the players are still making the same decisions (or worse, fewer because the new mechanics provide some kind of optimal path), then rethink your mechanic.<br><br>Note that if the players&#39; decisions are driving the answer to the questions of the game, then <b>you can&#39;t know the answers ahead of time</b>.  I deliberately avoid planning what will happen - even to the point of thinking about how cool things might be, and then stopping myself from thinking about that.<br><br>Questions and decisions.  Get those, and you&#39;re pretty much golden.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/105581305999950753269">Artur Fiedorowicz</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JackThomasTheOriginal">Jack Thomas</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TomTysonbluetyson">Blue Tyson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulVencill">Paul Vencill</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104778703342814527599">Gerald Rose</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106644250506621056571">Scott Belchak</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105819537446550907330">Porter Williams</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MikeLindsey">Mike Lindsey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherGlew">chris glew</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115484991119248632805">Brett Bowen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110157842650270302013">Christopher Moore</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/117339120880691026332">Andru Matthews</a></div></div><meta itemprop="commentCount" content="10"><div class="comments"><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/110157842650270302013" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Christopher Moore</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-10-25T17:53:44-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">The issue I have with this level of campaign design is how some players like to &quot;experience living in the setting.&quot; When a GM insists on skipping over scenes that don&#39;t have an interesting question, they skip over the player&#39;s chance to &quot;feel like your living in the setting&quot;.

Otherwise you would be doing it real time and end up with seven hour games where no one did anything because the characters were asleep. Or Would you want to go into detail about how the character is using the facilities?

The question is causal in nature, it does not tell you how the players should go about it or how the GM should deal with how they go about it.
