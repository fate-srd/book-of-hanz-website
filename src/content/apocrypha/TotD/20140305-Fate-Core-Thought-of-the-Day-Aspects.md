 Especially in a play, everything that&#39;s there should be there for a reason.  There&#39;s a deliberate choice that&#39;s made to focus on what&#39;s important, and remove everything that isn&#39;t.<br><br>We see this in TV shows, movies, and books, as well, but not to as great of an extent.  Most of these media try to immerse their audience in the reality of what&#39;s happening, something that&#39;s generally not a goal for plays.  And so there might very well be a gun on the wall that never gets fired, or a shadow that nobody leaps out of.<br><br>But the camera will never focus on those things.  And that&#39;s a useful way of looking at it, as well - an aspect is something that gets camera focus in describing the scene.<br><br>To put it another way, there&#39;s a difference between a scene being dark, and a scene being Dark.  A dark scene may be a poorly lit bar - but the lighting is just ambience.  It doesn&#39;t influence the plot in any way.  It doesn&#39;t really impact how the characters do things.  It&#39;s just there to set a mood.<br><br>A Dark scene is different.  In a Dark scene, we can expect somebody to jump out of the shadows at some point, or disappear into them.<br><br>And that&#39;s kind of what aspects are.  They&#39;re the things we&#39;re pointing out to the players as important.  We don&#39;t try to capture every detail, or worry about the minor things that have a slight influence on what happens.  Size advantages/disadvantages aren&#39;t a big deal, until you&#39;re talking about something on the level of Bruce Lee vs. Kareem Abdul Jabaar... yeah, one guy might have a slightly longer reach, and one guy might be slightly faster, yada, yada, yada, but all of those are minor factors.<br><br>Fate worries about the major factors.  It worries about the big things that will swing how the scenes play out.  It doesn&#39;t worry about the minor effects, even though those certainly can add up to a big effect - but it assumes that, like a TV show or movie, that those turn out to be a wash most of the time.<br><br>Now, since we don&#39;t have full control of the story, we can&#39;t fully obey the law of Chekov&#39;s Gun.  But it&#39;s important to keep in mind that every aspect should be something that <b>could</b> be important, and that <b>could</b> be something that causes the scene to swing a different way.<br><br>And that&#39;s why aspect &quot;spamming&quot; is kind of a bad thing.  The point of aspects is to restrict what the players have to think about, to restrict the important elements in a scene.  If your scene has a list of twenty aspects, then you&#39;ve destroyed this economy of information, and have reduced the value of calling out things as aspects in the first place.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/115685864345157156441">Valentina Mauro</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JuanmaBarranquero">Juanma Barranquero</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MarcusMorrisey">Marcus Morrisey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavidRourke">David Rourke</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105675834591618577037">Niall Maguire</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103504105091856974036">Paul Chapman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+EricWillisson">Eric Willisson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ScottAcker">Scott Acker (SaintAndSinner)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116368617254549940475">Mark Kowalizzinn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JBBell">JB Bell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108398535426911426153">Justin Hall</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104863449311090340090">Otter Shaman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GerritReininghaus">Gerrit Reininghaus</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SamuelSteinbockPratt">Samuel Steinbock-Pratt</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115484991119248632805">Brett Bowen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanMDanks">Ryan M.

So, a gun is a sort of character that can be Out of Ammo. That Aspect, fractally speaking, is similar to the one the character firing the gun might have, &quot;Mad as Hell, and Not Taking it Anymore!&quot;<br><br>Dude&#39;s not always mad right? Sometimes he does take it.<br><br>A gun&#39;s Out of Ammo Aspect must be Compelled for it to matter. If that older ideas is being used then everything that is a gun has that Aspect, and it&#39;s just waiting to be Compelled. It is true of every gun with ammo that it can be out of ammo, so it&#39;s pretty much pointless to even write it down.<br><br>These would be cases where Chekhov&#39;s Gun is there, and not important at all to the story. They are Focal Aspects of the character, and Scene, but not the story.<br><br>If we apply your idea to the PCs themselves we can even determine that at some points in a session certain PCs didn&#39;t matter at all due to their die rolls, choices, etc. They become the unused gun, not for lack of trying though.<br><br>I think that in effective narration anything that is said will have impact. In writing, and oration more so than film, and television, because there are less senses involved. <br><br>The chief difference between a piece by Chekov, and a Fate game is that he is the sole determining factor in whether that giun matters. The determinant factor in a Fate game is multiplied by however many people are at the table, and find the gun compelling.<br><br>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a variable that directly controllable by anyone in a game.<br><br>This is why I ponder the relevance of the audience. By creating a standard by which to judge play we create a situation where one party might tell another that a certain thing isn&#39;t worth introducing, because it may not matter. Obviously, to the person introducing said concept, it very much matters though. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+BrianRock" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Brian Rock</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-03-06T01:04:13-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">&quot;But it&#39;s important to keep in mind that every aspect should be something that could be important, and that could be something that causes the scene to swing a different way.<br><br>And that&#39;s why aspect &quot;spamming&quot; is kind of a bad thing.  The point of aspects is to restrict what the players have to think about, to restrict the important elements in a scene. &quot;<br><br>&quot;Spamming&quot; aspects can be an issue. Although Core and FAE trimmed character aspects back, the focus on the four actions really put the spotlight on Create Advantage. As a result players and GM&#39;s create a lot more advantages than we did in SotC or Bulldogs!<br><br>In a recent FAE game I had two initial situation aspects, eight aspects from create advantage, four from consequences, plus two from boosts = 16 non-character or setting aspects. Urk.<br><br>The recent clarification on boosts not being full-blown aspects helps with two of these, but that still leaves half (eight out of sixteen) added because of create advantage.<br><br>I&#39;m still not entirely sure how to keep this under control. Perhaps using more overarching aspects, like <i>Dangerous Environment</i> instead of <i>Roof on Fire</i> and <i>Toxic Gas</i> and <i>Blacked Out Casino</i>.

I bash the cultist over the head with a creepy candelabra!&quot;<br><br>I didn&#39;t even say there was one there, but why not?<br><br>Since everything I say is a potential Aspect that may have associated Aspects I hadn&#39;t considered there isn&#39;t really a point to writing them down as such. I let the players determine what will be important.<br><br>I think this may be a reason I don&#39;t understand why people fear Aspect Spamming so much. Since Aspects are built to be somewhat disposable I suppose I don&#39;t really see the point in making note of them at all unless they gain so much focus that it makes sense to start detailing the Aspects they themselves possess.<br><br>Like <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/103306554028074451796" oid="103306554028074451796" >Richard Bellingham</a></span>&#39;s <b>piles of trash</b> that he didn&#39;t even care about when writing that. A player might not use either of the Aspects that he thought were important, but the trash? They love that, and start digging. <br><br>At that point I would bust out an index card, and note Piles of Trash, and make bullet points beneath it as I listed off what they found. Those things are Aspects of the trash. Some of them may have Aspects of their own as well. <br><br>I only track Aspect that become fleshed out, so I&#39;ve never seen Aspect Spam first hand. I suppose I understand it in the Abstract, but I tend to think it comes from wanting to document everything, which I do not.</div></div></div></body></html>
