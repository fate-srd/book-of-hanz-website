 Here&#39;s a more concrete example.<br><br>You&#39;re providing <b><i>Covering Fire</i></b>.  Then, you go inside a cave that has no visibility to the area you were providing covering fire for.  What happens?<br><br>So, if we do a &quot;mechanics first&quot; approach (or, &quot;primacy of the bits&quot; if you want), there&#39;s an aspect there, and we need to have some mechanical interaction to get rid of the <b><i>Covering Fire</i></b> aspect, or maybe it&#39;s even there.  It seems a bit.... odd.<br><br>But from a &quot;fiction first&quot; approach, it all just... works.  The aspect is just a reflection of the &#39;reality&#39; of your PC providing covering fire.  If you&#39;re in the cave, you&#39;re clearly not providing covering fire any more, and so there&#39;s no reason for there to be an aspect, right?<br><br>And that, right there, is the core of &quot;fiction first&quot;.  The mechanics do not define the reality.  They merely <i>reflect</i> the reality, and specifically only certain parts of it.  If the imagined reality ever conflicts with the mechanical bits, the imagined reality wins.<br><br>And when we start applying this idea more broadly, a lot of things become really obvious.  Have a <b><i>Broken Leg</i></b> consequence?  Weird that it means you can&#39;t climb a ladder without a Compel?  Yeah, that would be weird.  But, <i>in the fiction</i>, it makes perfect sense that you can&#39;t just climb a ladder if you have a broken leg, right?  We don&#39;t even get to the point of a roll or anything else, because the fiction coming first tells us that the action doesn&#39;t even make any sense to begin with.<br><br>This isn&#39;t how all games work!  Many games have lists of specific conditions, that tell you exactly what you can and can&#39;t do, with specific modifiers and conditions.   And that causes a lot of confusion - people see &quot;Aspects can be invoked for +2 or Compelled&quot; and assume that&#39;s all they can do, because those are the only mechanical effects.  <br><br>But that&#39;s not even half of the story - yes, those are the pure mechanical effects (apart from providing passive opposition), but since aspects are <b>true</b>, and the fiction <b>leads</b>, then any logical consequence of those aspects is true as well.  And, really, again, the aspect is just a note, a reflection of the imagined &#39;reality&#39; in the first place.<br><br>To me, fully understanding this idea is the point at which Fate goes from being a fairly complex game to being an incredibly simple and streamlined game, and the point at which it really begins to &quot;sing&quot;.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/101324600825687754874">James R</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/118404539433068121199">Владимир Петриченко</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JasonCoffin108">Jason Coffin</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GerritReininghaus">Gerrit Reininghaus</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117120467785195629704">Scott Lorch</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/107301245085160537831">Martin Cumming</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+EricWillisson">Eric Willisson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ŁukaszMatylla">Łukasz Matylla</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106971899589183843189">Marie Olive</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ScottAcker">Scott Acker (SaintAndSinner)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103795633883852985551">Christopher Dylan</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MichałZemełka">Michał Zemełka</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117163883040935787941">Marek Spyrzewski</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105049882225078661084">Zachary St Lawrence</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109896501573129830808">Thinker Monkey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherRuthenbeck">Christopher Ruthenbeck</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristophThill">Christoph Thill</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105744801865415448106">Christopher Moore</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106770271573113597455">todd estabrook</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113113434693868614887">Jeremy Downey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114026319786381021724">Angela Robertson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105912177797448389192">Christopher Dyszelski</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamSchwaninger">Adam Schwaninger</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulVencill">Paul Vencill</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MarcPReyes">Marc P.

That principle has never gone away, IMHO - and it&#39;s very much a given group&#39;s preference as to how much or little consensus they use to resolve decision nodes and inflection points as opposed to going to the rules - it&#39;s a dial rather than a binary switch.

Success at cost calls for serious cost always, but I feel going for table consensus might work better. Some people at the simulationist end might still be more comfortable with an Attack instead, even though that is more swingy than table consensus (which might be what they&#39;re looking for).

As a gamer who enjoys gritty characters and stories, this has been a realization that helped me grok Fate a little better and give it another go after my initial poorly executed attempt.<br><br>Game of Thrones, for example, has a setting and story that is praised by many I have spoken to as a &quot;highly believable world&quot;, in that often people die without objective reason, the world is harsh and unforgiving, and the characters are motivated (mostly) by highly tangible ambitions... plus all the brutal combat, of course.<br><br>For a long while, I thought that was a genre of storytelling that a Fate-style game could not accomplish; how can you have brutality, a harsh world, betrayal, bloody duels, and that grime-and-grit <b>feel</b> without finding all the knobs and bitz and tacking them on to the most lethal and unforgiving system you can find?<br><br>It was not until I came back to Fate that I realized, it is <b>exactly</b> and precisely the type of thing Fate is meant to accomplish (within certain parameters). What bridged the gap for me was when I realized that Ned Stark was not simply a man with a code of honor that led him into an unfortunate series of circumstances that got him executed through GM fiat, but that he had in fact attempted to wage a war of ideologies and honor with a sea of soulless aristocratic backstabbers; the failure of which simply culminated in his imprisonment, being socially Taken Out, and ultimately death/removal from the narrative.<br><br>In GURPS terms, a lot of player characters die in a lot of really foolhardy and/or accidental ways, most probably driven by a lot of Disadvantages and incomplete planning.<br><br>In Fate terms, there was arguably a huge amount of social conflict, a massive number of concessions, and ultimately a few PC&#39;s and their corresponding underlings who got Taken Out in a series of memorable and purposeful events.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone off on a tangent, but my point is that while GURPS might model the blade coming down and the spinal trauma and finally the head separation, Fate has modeled everything <b>up to</b> that point in time; death is simply the inevitable outcome of the preceding events, unworthy of mechanical definition on its own.<br><br>You can have plausible verisimilitude (i.e. realism) in both a &quot;simulationist&quot; or &quot;narrative&quot; flavor, but ultimately realism itself is about genre and convention, not physics. You can run a Toon game or a Godfather game in both GURPS and Fate; the only question is, which form of realism or fantasy are you looking for?</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-04-20T18:59:34-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/106428250748750351005" oid="106428250748750351005" >Daniel Cathey</a></span>:  ONE OF US!<br><br>I&#39;d also mention that Consequences provide a lot more in terms of &quot;lasting consequences from wounds&quot; than a ton of systems.<br><br>Also:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz/posts/iGBaeXT7PKw" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz/posts/iGBaeXT7PKw</a></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/106428250748750351005" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Daniel Cathey</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2015-04-20T19:03:21-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> Woohoo!

I saved it for future Fate threads but now I&#39;m posting it here. <br><br>...<br><br><br>Aspects are about spending Fate Points to Invoke them or earning Fate Points to Compel them, right?<br><br>Wrong. <br><br>This is how Aspects actually work:<br>&gt; 1) Aspects are always true<br>&gt; 2) Aspects give permissions<br>&gt; 3) Aspects are clearly phrased<br>&gt; 4) Aspects move the adventure forward.<br><br>To illustrate why those are the pillars of all good Aspects, let&#39;s assume the opposite of each. <br><br>&gt; An Aspect is not true<br>Why give a character Aspects like &quot;Super-Strong,&quot; &quot;Billionaire Industrialist,&quot; or &quot;Student of Wizardry&quot; if your character is not super-strong, a billionaire industrialist, or a student of wizardry? Why would you give your character Aspects that they could never Invoke or be Compelled for if they aren&#39;t true and therefore could never move the adventure forward because they are irrelevant?<br><br>&gt; An Aspect doesn&#39;t grant permissions<br>If I have a &quot;Billionaire Industrialist&quot; my character had better 1) have a net worth in the billions, 2) have the various perks that come with being so wealthy, and 3) know a thing or two about business and the industry that he or she makes money from. Those things and more should be implied and agreed upon when the GM signs off on it. If I get none of those things then why would I have an Aspect that says I do? The Aspect is no longer true. How do I Invoke or Compel it if I don&#39;t even have what it says? <br><br>&gt; Aspects are not clear<br>What good is an Aspect that no one understands? How is anyone supposed to know what&#39;s true about your character if we don&#39;t understand how you derive those truths from your phraseology? How can we trust that you get certain permissions or not others if you vaguely word it? How does anyone know when to Invoke or Compel your bad Aspect? How are they supposed to use it?<br><br>&gt; Aspects don&#39;t move the story forward<br>Why would you sink Fate Points into an Aspect that accomplishes nothing? Why would you ever get a Compel if nothing that matters to anyone or anything gets complicated as a result of it?<br><br>Fate is not about the Fate Points. The Fate Points are an abstraction that facilitates the interplay of Aspects. <br><br>When I Create Advantage, I&#39;m establishing new truths that grant new permissions and which move the adventure forward. <br><br>When I Attack, the end result is that my opponents have Consequences which are... Aspects. A Broken Arm is a new truth about one&#39;s character which affects what they can do; what they are permitted to do. It presents new opportunities to advance the adventure if that character&#39;s Broken Arm is exploited for good or bad. <br><br>When I Defend, I am trying to prevent a new truth from emerging. <br><br>And when I Overcome, I am eliminating the truths and permissions that stand in my character&#39;s way, which only moves the adventure further forward.<br><br>For my allies are the Aspects. And powerful allies they are. Gameplay creates them, makes them grow. Their energy surrounds us and binds us as player-characters. Narrative beings are they, not this crude matter. You must feel the Aspects around you. Here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere! Yes, even between the land and the ship.﻿</div></div></div></body></html>
