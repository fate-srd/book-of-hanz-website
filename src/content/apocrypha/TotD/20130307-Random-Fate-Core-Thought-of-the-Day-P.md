 Where was the conflict?  Where was the story?  Nowhere, that&#39;s where.<br><br>What I <b>should</b> have done was frame this in a scene.  &quot;Okay, Eddie, the plane&#39;s in the hangar with the other planes.  When are you doing this?  At night, when nobody can see?  Or are you being open about it?  What do the mechanics think of you messing with the plane?  What about the other pilots?&quot;<br><br>Then, I could have some framing for the scene.  Once I&#39;ve tied this to a specific place and time, it becomes a lot more interesting - other pilots can show up.  The mechanics can show up themselves.  Compels start to suggest themselves.  Conflict.  Drama.  Story.  The reasons we play.<br><br>So that&#39;s my big zen moment for the day.  Any time something happens, frame it in a scene.  Contacts roll?  Okay, where are they going that&#39;s appropriate to find these people?  Investigate?  Okay, they&#39;re in a library or pounding the streets.  And given the new scene, how can you absolutely screw with them?  What opposed interests can be there, what complications can arise?  There is absolutely no mechanic that can&#39;t be improved by framing it in a scene.  Fiction, not physics - if you wanted to get the desired result in a TV show, how would you show it on camera?<br><br>And it goes the other way, as well.  You want your players asking for scenes so they can do stuff.  Let them get the crew together before the mission to make a Rapport roll and inspire them, getting a few free invokes on a newly created scene aspect.  Get them in a diner with the Big Bad for a brief war of words, ala Heat.<br><br>There&#39;s another subtle benefit of thinking in scenes.  Things <b>happen</b> in scenes.  If you&#39;re in the &quot;physics simulation&quot; mode of what happens moment-to-moment, it&#39;s easy to get stuck playing a lot of boring stuff.  But if you frame it in a scene, you&#39;ve got to ask the big scene questions first - What is this scene about?  What&#39;s at stake?  What could go wrong?  What interesting thing is about to happen?  And if you don&#39;t have interesting answers to those questions, it&#39;s probably not an interesting scene and should just be skipped over.  If your game was a TV show or a movie, would they waste script time on this?<br><br>Ramp it up.  Put a scene on it.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NathanMcCoy">Nathan McCoy</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MattPetruzzelli">Matt Petruzzelli</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DanHall">Dan Hall</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/107896009439877948540">Chase Rude</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RobMeyers">Rob Meyers</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AshWalter">Ash Walter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JBBell">JB Bell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RafaelSantAnnaMeyer">Rafael Sant&#39;Anna Meyer</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117173750916615651123">Rich Knight</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BillGarrett">Bill Garrett</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JakeÖn">Jake Ön</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105179574276953345976">Jeff Johnston</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JackGulick">Jack Gulick</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GeoffSkellams">Geoff Skellams</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116748546962488989608">Adam Minnie</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103023393131901177911">David Thomas</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ZachHunt">Zach Hunt</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JaredHayter">Jared Hayter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MichaelPedersen">Michael Pedersen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JavierGaspoz">Javier Gaspoz</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+CameronCorniuk">Cameron Corniuk</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114849231483871582524">Hollis McCray</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102932063319431155383">Michael Cullen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChuckDurfee">Chuck Durfee</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/107774768973534883378">Adam Kuśmirek</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102407588352736538249">Frank Beaver</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NickPilon">Nick Pilon</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton">Wil Hutton</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ClarkValentine">Clark Valentine</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks">Fred Hicks</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JoshLeavitt">Josh Leavitt (Locke)</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JacobZimmermanCrapEDM">Jacob Zimmerman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TJKing">T.J.

RPG books tend to teach you to read piecemeal. I blame White Wolf for this trend. They would place the stuff you need to know all over the place and then hide it behind mountains of fluff. It trains the brain to ignore most of teh book and only look for the parts you need at the moment.<br><br>Scene framing is one of those things I wish their was more written on, as it is really key to the game experience. I know I often fail at properly framing a scene and when I go back through the recording I wince at a lot of my choices. One of the other things to talk about when framing a scene is what are the stakes of the scene? What is causing the tension? What is the price for failing? Then you have to get that information to teh players, so that they can make an informed decision. Also, at some point, I think their needs to be a long discussion of Bangs and what they mean within the context of Fate Core.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-07T15:08:36-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I of course wasn&#39;t talking about your games, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/110682395387731432977" oid="110682395387731432977" >Jacob Poss</a></span> .  Now stop fishing for compliments ;)<br><br>Seriously, you do a lot of this stuff really, really well.  Though I get that you and I both have the issue of always asking&quot;what could I have done better?&quot; and not looking at what we&#39;ve done well.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JavierGaspoz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Javier Gaspoz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-07T15:39:04-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">/gone to read chapter 9 ;)</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/103023393131901177911" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">David Thomas</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-07T17:38:52-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Great post man.
