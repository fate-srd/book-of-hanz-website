game with this guy, and he basically said he didn&#39;t see how that could work in Burning Wheel, and I totally didn&#39;t understand it.<br><br>Character creation seemed normal, and I did a lot of the usual things.  Specifically, I had taken an Enemy character, as well as a friend.  We worked up backstories for our characters, and awaited the first session.<br><br>Then we started playing.  It quickly became apparent that the enemy was a significant enemy of the game.  It quickly became apparent that the story was <b>about</b> our characters, in a way that a D&amp;D game isn&#39;t - it was <b>our</b> story, not a story that you could drop random characters into.<br><br>This was one of the first &quot;aha!&quot; moments for me with narrative gaming.  Backstories aren&#39;t &quot;just&quot; backstories.  They&#39;re stories.  They&#39;re what drives the game forward.<br><br>And that&#39;s why I love Fate character creation.<br><br>First, it&#39;s one of the few character creation systems that focuses first on <b>who</b> a character is, rather than <b>what</b> a character can <b>do</b>.  I find it in many ways hard to create characters in other systems now, as it&#39;s an exercise in point optimization.  Bleah.<br><br>The shared stories also present the party a good reason to know each other, and do a great job of banishing &quot;you meet in a bar&quot;.<br><br>But the real reason I enjoy character creation in Fate is more than these.  It&#39;s the Phase Trio.  It&#39;s creating and enriching stories about these characters.  Because each time I go through the exercise, we end up with a plethora of threats and antagonists in the world.  We end up with story threads that need to go somewhere, and that I want to find out what happens with.  I end up with complex relationships that I want to see resolve in an interesting way.<br><br>I can&#39;t imagine running a Fate game where character creation didn&#39;t influence coming events.  And if I played in one where our pasts didn&#39;t come into play, I&#39;d kind of feel like something was left out.<br><br>I&#39;ve learned to dislike the term &quot;backstory&quot; when it comes to Fate characters.  Backstory implies that it&#39;s the past, and in many gaming circles carries the connotation that it&#39;s only important from a motivational view - after all, the story was probably created before you made your characters.  But your character&#39;s history isn&#39;t that in Fate.  It&#39;s what drives the game.  It&#39;s what creates complications, and gives players the chance to decide what type of game they want to play.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+OliverGraf">Oliver Graf</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan">Teo Morgan</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ZachHunt">Zach Hunt</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104892928505684381674">Mike Thompson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113994280385109224514">Dain Lybarger</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RobMeyers">Rob Meyers</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112536115051160493758">Jonathan Carr</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116118777360024444729">Björn Steffen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/103023393131901177911">David Thomas</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106045263770912373526">Bastien Daugas</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ScottAcker">Scott Acker (SaintAndSinner)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JoshLeavitt">Josh Leavitt (Locke)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RonFrazier">Ron Frazier</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks">Fred Hicks</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MarkDiazTruman">Mark Diaz Truman</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan">Teo Morgan</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112536115051160493758">Jonathan Carr</a></div></div><meta itemprop="commentCount" content="3"><div class="comments"><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+MarkDiazTruman" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Mark Diaz Truman</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-03-14T16:20:06-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">&quot;The past is never dead.
