 I don&#39;t think it would, because the core questions and assumptions of D&amp;D are very different than those of Fate.  Which, again, isn&#39;t a knock on Fate or on D&amp;D, much like saying that my Wrangler isn&#39;t as fast as a Ferrari isn&#39;t a knock on my Wrangler.<br><br>So, what are the things that I consider to be &quot;Fate&quot;?  Not as some kind of purity test, but rather as a more general gauge - if I see a Fate build that hits 95% of these, it&#39;ll probably &quot;feel like&quot; Fate to me.  But if I see something that&#39;s ostensibly Fate that only hits 10% of things, it probably won&#39;t push those Fate buttons very well.<br><br><b>Proactive characters</b><br>This is, to me, one of the biggest.  Fate characters are proactive.  They make things happen.  The game progresses as a result of their actions.<br><br>This seems like all games, but it&#39;s really not - it&#39;s an argument that railroading doesn&#39;t belong in Fate games.  If you know what&#39;s going to happen, then at some level the characters aren&#39;t proactive.  They&#39;re just looking for the magic &quot;next scene&quot; button.  They have no real agency.  And some games and styles are built heavily upon this kind of game structure.  Which is fine - I just don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s a good fit for Fate.<br><br>It also makes it a good question whether investigation-based games are a super-awesome fit for Fate, either.  Investigation-based games are usually about following the breadcrumb that is left, which is often not very proactive on the part of the players.  It also makes the level of narrative control that Fate gives players somewhat problematic.<br><br><b>Competent characters</b><br>Fate characters are competent.  They&#39;re <b>good</b> at stuff.  Maybe not the best in the world, but whatever they&#39;re good at, they&#39;re <b>good</b> at it.  They&#39;re not bumbling amateurs.<br><br><b>Skills, aspects, compels, invokes</b><br>To me, this is the core of Fate.  You can get rid of stunts and still have it &quot;feel like&quot; Fate, but if these four elements don&#39;t work more or less how they do in Core, it doesn&#39;t feel much like Fate to me.<br><br><b>The phase trio</b><br>This has been around, and almost unchanged, since SotC.  It works, and how it generates interlinked characters is, to me, a pretty important part of the Fate experience.<br><br><b>Lack of charop</b><br>As a game, Fate seems to almost go out of its way to minimize character optimization.  Discussion of what stunts do is directly opposed to the idea of &quot;hey, let me find the combination of stuff that makes me awesome&quot;, as a general table veto is <b>built into</b> the process.<br><br><b>&quot;Final&quot; skills</b><br>One of the things I really appreciate about Fate is the idea that skills represent your <b>final</b> ability to influence a scene - not your base ability that&#39;s then modified by a gazillion other factors.  This ties in pretty heavily with the charop point above.<br><br><b>Lack of emphasis on system mastery</b><br>Fate is, to me, not a game about learning to manipulate the game system.  It&#39;s a game about the <b>fiction</b> (as in, the stuff we&#39;re imagining in our heads), not the rules.  The rules get out of the way more than anything, and it&#39;s hard to have system mastery be important if you&#39;re trying to de-emphasize the system.<br><br>Attempts to make Fate &quot;crunchy&quot; (that is, to make system mastery a more important thing) to me make games feel less like Fate.<br><br><b>Branches, not gates</b><br>Scenes in Fate games to me work best as a series of possible branches.  They&#39;re not challenges to be overcome.  If there&#39;s a 95% chance of success at no cost, there&#39;s no real point in having a scene.<br><br><b>Focus on opportunity cost</b><br>This is a big one to me.  Unlike games that focus on system mastery and overcoming challenges, Fate to me works best when opportunity cost is shoved in the players&#39; faces.  That&#39;s a question that appears over and over in Fate - spending Fate points to buy a victory, success at a cost, accepting Compels - all of these point directly at the idea of &quot;how much do you want this, and what are you willing to give up to get it?&quot;<br><br>If a Fate game de-emphasizes this, to me it starts to feel less like Fate.  Hacks to Fate that do things like require the pre-spending of Fate Points or the like feel less-&quot;Fate&quot; to me.<br><br><b>A focus on what&#39;s important in the story, not modeling reality</b><br>If you think on most fiction, the weapon that a given combatant uses isn&#39;t particularly relevant most of the time.  The fact that someone uses an axe vs. a sword isn&#39;t going to mean that they lose in a scene.  Sure, there are special pieces of equipment, but they tend to be just that - special.<br><br>To me, a good Fate game approaches its systems in that way - what&#39;s actually important, in this genre?  Do characters tend to lose fights because they&#39;re not armed with bigger weapons or sturdier armor?  If not, then that shouldn&#39;t be how your game models it, either.<br><br>A good example of this is thinking about mecha.  How many stats should a mech have, and how much of its combat ability should be based on it instead of its pilot?  And that boils down to - &#39;what story are you telling&#39;?  If it&#39;s about the pilot, and a good pilot in a weak or mediocre mecha can still be an effective combatant, then the mecha should only have a modifying impact on the pilot&#39;s skills, and the story will focus around the pilots.  But if the story should focus around the attainment of awesome mecha, then they should have a larger impact.  It&#39;s not a matter of what&#39;s &quot;realistic&quot;.  It&#39;s a matter of &quot;what impact does this have on the game, and what elements do I want to be important in the game?&quot;<br><br><b>Active instead of passive bonuses</b><br>A big thing with Fate, to me, is the idea that most bonuses are active - they&#39;re the result of things that you <b>do</b>.  This fits in with the &quot;proactive&quot; part of characters as well.  This compares to other games where much of the game is focused on &quot;how many bonuses can I find a way to make apply?&quot;  That can be a great type of game - but it ain&#39;t (to me) Fate.<br><br><b>Skills tied to results, not actions</b><br>Another biggie.  In many games, using a skill means you&#39;re engaging in a specific task that may have a variable result.  In Fate, I see it more as &quot;I&#39;m trying to accomplish this - do I succeed?&quot;  It seems subtle, but it&#39;s a pretty important point, and colors how a lot of mechanics get applied.<br><br><b>Bell curve results</b><br>Fate uses a randomization scheme that is heavily biased towards &quot;average&quot; results.  It doesn&#39;t use a flat distribution.  How that is specifically achieved, or exactly how biased it is, is somewhat more open - but a flat distribution doesn&#39;t feel like Fate to me.<br><br>Anyway, those are the main things I can think of, at least for now.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll add more later!<br><br>And these are just my opinions.  They&#39;re not the word of God, and others will absolutely have different lists, and even things that they think I just got totally <b>wrong</b>.  But, to me, this is kind of the core of what I consider to be &quot;Fate&quot; - and, if you look at it, a good predictor of what games I&#39;ll generally say don&#39;t feel &quot;Fate-like&quot; to me.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/104913010130462847190">Jon Smejkal</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MichaelSimsX">Michael Sims</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116948490555602883045">John Rogers</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MikeLindsey">Mike Lindsey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulVencill">Paul Vencill</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimNoyce">Tim Noyce</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576">Paul Kießhauer</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+EdenBrandeis">Eden Brandeis</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JulioLopezwin">Julio Lopez</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BryanThrall">Bryan Thrall</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WadeRockett">Wade Rockett</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChipDunning">Chip Dunning</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JeanChristopheCubertafon">Jean-Christophe Cubertafon</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SophieLagace">Sophie Lagace</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+StuartMcDermid">Stuart McDermid</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112845952475097733098">Phil Lewis</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111937671651246346867">Antaeus Feldspar</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101111026399515749527">Steve Ainsworth</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ZachHunt">Zach Hunt</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110955367092905312627">Scott Lorch</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton">Wil Hutton</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109445681594405797785">David Silberstein</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ShaneHarsch">Shane Harsch</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115484991119248632805">Brett Bowen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116260548667763245092">Didier Bretin</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SeanSmithM">Sean Smith</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SheaValentine">Shea Valentine</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherRuthenbeck">Christopher Ruthenbeck</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/117339120880691026332">Andru Matthews</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112732791016140171187">Mark Arndt</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton">Wil Hutton</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TJKing">T.J.

If a system can be mastered, there&#39;s always going to be a battle around the table on who has found the better secret tricks to squeeze out the most for themselves.

Great food for thought.<br><br>I think one important thing you left out is the way players and GM work together. I&#39;ve not seen that in any other game. It starts with setting and character creation, which I&#39;ve seen brushed aside by a lot of groups I&#39;ve played in. The GM creates a campaign at home, the players create individual characters at home and when they meet, they wonder how to get things to work together. Just the idea to spend the whole first session creating the setting and the characters <b>together</b> is a big part of what makes Fate great to me. So much so, that I think this should be a big part of every game, it&#39;s just so integral to everything that comes afterwards.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+PKSullivan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">PK Sullivan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-12-03T16:32:18-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Could you unpack the thought about &quot;final skills&quot; a bit?</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112845952475097733098" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Phil Lewis</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-12-03T17:04:57-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Fate <b>is</b> a specific game, and I think you&#39;ve captured the essence of it very well.

 For a label to have any kind of value whatsoever, it has to provide information about the thing that it&#39;s labeling - if two games that both claim to be &quot;Fate&quot; (as in, they&#39;re claiming to be the same game, not just randomly picking the same name) have absolutely no commonalities, then I&#39;d argue that the label &quot;Fate&quot; is meaningless.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean that a game that has been modified so much that it becomes its own entity is a <b>bad</b> game, or is in any way<br><br>Now, I&#39;m definitely more on the side of a game being defined more by its structure and the playstyles and &#39;needs&#39; it supports well, rather than by specific mechanics.  It might be that for you, Aspects + 4dF = Fate, and so regardless of how those basic elements are used, a game with Aspects + 4df is Fate and should be called that.<br><br>If you disagree on the specific list of things that I gave, well, I <b>totally</b> expect that.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ll respond to your post with more on this, but I really don&#39;t intend this to be a &quot;must have checklist&quot;, and if a game doesn&#39;t do all of these things then it&#39;s &quot;NOT FATE OMG YUR DOIN IT RONG!&quot;  I expect that most Fate builds will vary in some ways, and not include every point I list above.<br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/116761186641421769426" oid="116761186641421769426" >Gabriel Whitehead</a></span>: &quot;I hate the D&amp;D system and would have more fun coming as close to emulating D&amp;D as FAE will allow me.&quot;<br><br>I think it&#39;s likely that you just don&#39;t care about the things D&amp;D does well.  It probably wasn&#39;t a good fit for the type of game you want in the first place.<br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102049580828651713018" oid="102049580828651713018" >PK Sullivan</a></span>: &quot;Could you unpack the thought about &quot;final skills&quot; a bit?&quot;<br><br>Sure:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940/s/fate%20doesn%27t%20go%20to%20eleven" class="ot-anchor bidi_isolate" jslog="10929; track:click" dir="ltr">https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940/s/fate%20doesn&#39;t%20go%20to%20eleven</a><br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117270617495082075619" oid="117270617495082075619" >Aaron Hendrix</a></span>: Those are great posts.  They seem to mostly be approaching it from a mechanics view, as opposed to what I&#39;m doing here in terms of a gameplay experience view.<br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576" oid="112230078537377625576" >Paul Kießhauer</a></span>:  &quot;Just the idea to spend the whole first session creating the setting and the characters together is a big part of what makes Fate great to me.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, that&#39;s kind of what I meant in talking about the Phase Trio, though I should have expanded that further into the collaborative setting/character creation thing as a whole.<br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112845952475097733098" oid="112845952475097733098" >Phil Lewis</a></span>: &quot;I think there&#39;s room for drift all over the place, though, and maybe some interesting games to be made...&quot;<br><br>Absolutely.  The list isn&#39;t intended to be a 100% must have checklist.  It&#39;s more like &quot;things which are Fate-like&quot;.  If you hit 90% of them, your game is probably going to &quot;feel like Fate&quot; to me.<br><br>If you hit 20% of them, it may or may not &quot;feel like Fate&quot;, which is a totally orthogonal question to &quot;is this an awesome game or not?&quot;</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+ScottDiehl" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Scott Diehl</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-12-03T18:45:20-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I appreciate how constructive this post is: you don&#39;t say that nobody should try to hack fate in these ways, just that you wouldn&#39;t do so for the reasons you outline.

In addition, what the system (not just D&amp;D) does well, isn&#39;t always universally accepted.<br><br>In the end, with regard to all of these discussions, I sometimes feel that there is as much animosity (not by you, but by some) from those who feel that people should play systems that are built to do the thing they want to do toward those who feel that their pet system can do anything as good as or better than systems built to do those things, as vice-versa.<br><br>While I am currently of the mind set to use FAE for all things, I have played enough systems to know what they do best...and I often do care about those things. I can&#39;t, however, get passed the things I don&#39;t care for (classes, levels, spell lists, dice pools, skill lists and rules, equipment lists and rules, hit points, death spirals, too many fiddly bits, etc.), which at times could be what the system is good at. Basically, FAE is the most perfect system FOR ME that I have seen.<br><br>With that said, I do enjoy one-shots with other systems, especially at game days and conventions. I also like gaming with friends (I am currently in a weekly D&amp;D game and a monthly Shadowrun game...yes, I dislike both systems).<br><br>Finally, I not only appreciate diversity in game systems and supplements, but encourage continued growth, for a few reasons (love of the hobby being the biggest reason).<br><br>In other news, this post rambled well beyond the length I thought it would reach...﻿</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+MichaelLangford" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Michael Langford</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-12-04T22:32:38-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Fate plays a bit like D&amp;D at level 8 as far as the competency goes<br><br></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+SheaValentine" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Shea Valentine</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-12-04T22:37:26-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I pegged it at level 9.  Pretty close mechanically speaking.</div></div></div></body></html>
