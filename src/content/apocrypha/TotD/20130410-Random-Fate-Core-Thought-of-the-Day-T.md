I feel I need to bathe in disinfectant for having written it.<br><br>But that&#39;s the fundamental reason that aspects are &quot;fueled by&quot; Fate Points.  Nanoc&#39;s struggle against Baddaguy was the only place he really needed to swing the narrative, and constantly talking about his mighty barbarian thews is just <b>dull</b>.<br><br>Fate Core, as far as I can see, tries to emulate fiction.  That doesn&#39;t just mean &quot;a physical simulation of fictional worlds&quot;.  That means the flow and structure of fiction.  That means that when we look at how a game of Fate &#39;should&#39; flow, our reference point should be &#39;does this play out like a book, or a movie?&#39; rather than &#39;does this work like how it would work in the physical world&#39;?<br><br>A slippery, ice-covered surface, in fiction, doesn&#39;t mean that every description or shot of people on it involves them slipping and sliding around.  That&#39;s boring.  What it probably means is that at some key moment, somebody will slip because of the surface creating some dramatic moment.  And that&#39;s what Fate tries to emulate - how the <b>dramatic</b> elements work together, not the actual effects of fighting on a slippery surface.  It follows the rules of fiction - regardless of realism, not reality - even &#39;cinematic&#39; reality.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NicolaUrbinati">Nicola Urbinati</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102901513133381681285">Seth Halbeisen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+HectorTrelane">Hector Trelane</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117458562048817368743">Diamond B</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+HendrikBelitz">Hendrik Belitz</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116368617254549940475">Mark Kowalizzinn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110101057732293802384">Łukasz Gajewski</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DaveCockburn">Dave Cockburn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576">Paul Kießhauer</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101223885539785381547">Rob Alexander</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114849231483871582524">Hollis McCray</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/118098388322970103404">Jane Olszewska (3Jane)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanAech">Ryan Aech</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114113301211577453021">Matt Hewes</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AlexCorbett193">Grass Dragon (Grassdragon)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RobMeyers">Rob Meyers</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JonathanDietrich">Jonathan C.

Fate is first and foremost a GAME.<br><br>So as a game there is the consideration of gameplay, what a player is allowed by the rules to do, what a player is encouraged to do more often compared to other things he might also be allowed to do in the game. And as a game there is the notion of SUCCESS.<br><br>And &quot;succeed by failing&quot; is pretty lame and unfulfilling for most gamers. Succeed by winning, succeed by coming out on top of the opposition, by overcoming challenges, by solving puzzles, by leading the player character to a larger than life kind of virtual life in the game world, that has definitely more appeal to gamers.<br><br>So, from the viewpoint of an aspiring author, it might be considered &quot;dull&quot; or &quot;repetitive&quot;, if a player constantly employs the most effective game strategy to accumulate the largest possible bonus before (or after) rolling the dice. But from the viewpoint of a gamer this is the way to harvest success for the character AND to influence the story in the directest and most fulfilling way.<br><br>And - although the second text example shows, how repetitiously using the same Aspect might become a bit awkward from the viewpoint of literature critique - in actual play even using the same Aspect in each and every action of a character does NEVER occur in such a compressed, tight space of time as the text example suggests.<br><br>As a Fate player I don&#39;t consider myself as a &quot;writer&quot; of a story. Never. - I actually base my decisions about how I employ my character&#39;s abilities and my metagaming options as a player along dramatic goals I&#39;d like to achieve. But I&#39;d like to WIN, too! And if I&#39;m able to beat my opposition in-game I have a great time, great fun, and I enjoy playing my character and influencing the story by succeeding (preferably with style).<br><br>So I&#39;d actually like to squeeze out every last bit of character competency, of story-influencing power the character sheet allows. - And this includes using my Aspects as often as I please. - If I as a player have the opportunity to decide if and when to use an Aspect, and If I have the goal to create at the very least a story, that I find interesting - and probably my fellow players, too, then it is MY choice to use Aspects - even the same one - as I wish and as I am allowed by the rules.<br><br>What balances the possibility of this gaming strategy becoming a boring influence on the fellow players and therefore on the perception of the story by the majority of the group?<br><br>The Fate Point flow (economy is not a fitting word for what really happens around this metagaming resource flow).<br><br>A Fate player CAN NEVER &quot;abuse&quot; his Aspects! This is simply not possible. He spends Fate Points of which he doesn&#39;t have an endless supply. So every single spent Fate Point by default has to MATTER!<br><br>So any discussions at the gaming table whether a certain Aspect might not matter sufficiently to be used in an action are simply not necessary! - If I spend a Fate point, a rare(!) resource, it does matter. Always.<br><br>Fate points have to be earned, have to be accepted by accepting compels, generated by self-compels, etc. So there are the OTHER things that do matter in the game: the twists, the slings and arrows of fate that a character has to endure to be able to succeed (with style) in his endeavours.<br><br>And on a gamer&#39;s viewpoint, those complications are actively sought out, too! This is the metagaming part of Fate - entirely disjunct from the in-game story part. A gamer is encouraged or even forced (Compel) to generate or accept Fate points. This resouce is important.<br><br>So why not allow the players to reap their benefits from enduring the hardships of their characters by employing their Aspects as they wish?<br><br>As I&#39;ve said: You simply cannot &quot;abuse&quot; the use of Aspects in Fate. And even spending three or four Fate points in three or four consecutive actions ends with the player&#39;s metagaming resource &quot;on empty&quot;. So yes, those three actions seem a bit repetitive (as most action heroes actually use the very same tricks in nearly every action scene). But the story as a whole gets VERY different and interesting after this endulging in success, because the player will have to generate more Fate points - which is entirely &quot;non-dull&quot; as such.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ve never encountered the problem in any Fate/Fate Core game I&#39;ve played. But I do NOT consider the stories we played at our gaming table or in our Hangout games &quot;dull&quot; at all.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-04-10T18:40:54-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I think perhaps you&#39;ve misunderstood me, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/115091275373780411956" oid="115091275373780411956" >Frank Falkenberg</a></span>.  At no point have I ever recommended <b>any</b> limitation on aspect invocation besides that imposed by the availability of Fate points.<br><br>My point here is explaining what I see as the internal logic of why aspects <b>require</b> a fate point to invoke, rather than simply being invokable on-demand, regardless of fate point availability or usage.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RichardBellinghamSkimble" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Richard Bellingham (Skimble)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-04-10T18:41:31-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Frank: I think you&#39;ve slightly gone off on a tangent of Robert&#39;s point.
