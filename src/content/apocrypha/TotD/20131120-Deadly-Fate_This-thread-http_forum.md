There&#39;s a few things it could mean:<br><br>1) The characters lose more often<br>2) Combat goes faster - characters survive fewer hits.<br>3) A &quot;failed&quot; combat is more likely to result in death.<br>4) Retreat is harder to accomplish.<br>5) Some kind of death spiral exists.<br>6) Characters don&#39;t survive full on sword hits to the chest.<br><br>Some of these are somewhat related. Some aren&#39;t. I&#39;ll cover how I view them.<br><br>As a first question, exactly how often do you think characters <b>should</b> die? That&#39;s a useful calibration point.<br><br>1) This is the easiest one to handle - just use tougher opponents. It&#39;s easy to underestimate what opposition you should throw at players in Fate. If you want the FFV feel, don&#39;t make goblins mooks, make them supporting characters or better. Make every fight tough if the characters go in unprepared or unaware. Make Ogres truly epic challenges - +6 or higher peak skills, lots of stress - rather than low-mid-level cannon fodder.<br><br>2) This is mostly a matter of pacing, not inherently about deadliness. Still, this can be resolved either by minimizing/altering stress, having consequences soak damage, or using weapon/armor ratings where the weapons almost always outweigh the armor.<br><br>3) As the GM, narrate &quot;Taken Out&quot; to more often be &quot;death&quot;.<br><br>4) Be stingier on the requirements to Concede, or charge a Fate Point to do so.<br><br>5) Play up the narrative truth of consequences, and you get this within the rules as they exist.<br><br>6) Don&#39;t narrate low stress hits as gaping sword wounds. Narrate them as close calls, or some combination of fatigue/battering.<br><br>Fate is really, even as-is, pretty much as deadly as you want to make it.</span></div><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?709054-How-would-you-run-deadlier-FATE" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>How would you run deadlier FATE?</h3><img src="http://forum.rpg.net/RPGNET/images/rpgnetlogo2010.png" alt=""></a></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/115052207789261024447">Josha Petronis-Akins</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MertTorun">Mert Torun</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105819537446550907330">Porter Williams</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116477668513565402033">David Buswell-Wible</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SophieLagace">Sophie Lagace</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamSchwaninger">Adam Schwaninger</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton">Wil Hutton</a></div></div><meta itemprop="commentCount" content="15"><div class="comments"><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Fred Hicks</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-11-20T16:37:03-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">DFRPG adopted several of the items from your list in the interests of making things feel more dangerous.

I think the latter can be very democratic in the very basic sense that none of us are born with superpowers. (It&#39;s not surprising that D&amp;D originated before the significant bifurcation of wealth that began in the United States in the mid-70s, and which began to accelerate right around the time games like Vampire: the Masquerade became popular.)<br><br>But Fate is designed to work more like HeroQuest: you&#39;re a very competent character who is able to take significant risks. The question then becomes: is one of those risks death? And what things are worth risking death for? It seems like that question might make a good a campaign aspect in the game that&#39;s going to wrestle with the risk of death.﻿</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116761186641421769426" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Gabriel Whitehead</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-11-20T18:07:30-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">While in agreement with others, I will also note that unexpected (less dramatic) deaths do appeal to some players.

Every single hit suddenly becomes a life and death situation - very much like real life.  If you want your players more beaten than dead, add a Mild and Moderate consequence to prolong the pain. This way, they can suffer from consequences more and more often - for longer. You can also make it that if a Consequence is invoked against you, you suffer its full effect (the stress absorbed becomes a penalty rather than just the usual 2 Aspect penalty). Having a bad consequence would be truly bad then, even for a Fate Point, getting a -4 or -6 to your roll is quite bad.<br><br>For armour, you can have it add +1, +2 and maybe +3 to the consequence values to help absorb damage. You still take consequences, but the severity is much less because of the armour. For example, light armour +1 would be Mild (3), Moderate (5), Severe (7). It absorbs damage, but if you get hit, you still get hit and it matters.<br><br>The best part about Fate is that you can twiddle within the confines of the system and without stepping outside it and get an infinite number of permutations.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/105819537446550907330" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Porter Williams</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-11-20T21:03:57-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Sub</div></div></div></body></html>
