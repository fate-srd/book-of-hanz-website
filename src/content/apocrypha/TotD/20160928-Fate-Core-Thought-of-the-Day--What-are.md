Mostly because I see lots of people misunderstand (IMHO) what aspects are, and try to use them in inappropriate places, or for inappropriate things.<br><br>Mostly, people seem to view aspects as kind of combined Advantages/Disadvantages/Feats/Edges/etc.  And... they&#39;re mostly not that.<br><br>&quot;So, what are they then, Mr. Smarty Pants?&quot; you might ask.  And while my pants are indeed smarter than me, that&#39;s likely more about me than the pants.<br><br>Aspects are, simply put, established narrative facts.  And this is a definition that will either have you nodding along or be totally useless to you.  So, lemme drill a bit further into this.<br><br>Most game systems try to model reality - turns represent people doing things over discrete time slices, we try to figure out what would happen during this time bit, etc.<br><br>Not Fate.  Fate models how fiction works.  And not in the base sense of &quot;cinematic reality&quot; either - you can certainly have realistic fiction!  What Fate models is how scenes and camera shots work together to make things work and make sense.  This is one of the cool things about Fate!  We&#39;ve learned over <i>centuries</i> how to tell stories, so applying that knowledge to RPGs is a serious win!<br><br>(Of course, it also means that if you want a world-simulator, Fate&#39;s not really your bag.  Sorry about that.)<br><br>So, let&#39;s look at something I consider to be a perfect example of this.  In the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy, we see Star-Lord flying over the surface of a planet, and see geysers going off.  Cool stuff.  Later on, as he&#39;s trying to get away, one of those geysers goes off underneath the Milano, causing him problems.<br><br>Here&#39;s the thing - narratively, we can&#39;t just have the geyser go off under the Milano with no warning, or it feels abrupt and like &quot;cheating&quot; we have to establish that &quot;hey, geysers going off all over the place on this planet is <i>totally</i> a thing, so you know, if it happens, don&#39;t be surprised.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s a great example of a situation aspect.  As the GM describes the scene, and mentions the geysers, he writes down &quot;Crazy Geysers&quot; as a scene aspect, and then he&#39;s free to Compel it later.<br><br>Basically, an aspect is something that we&#39;ve introduced, that we&#39;ve established as something important or notable, that we can then later &quot;cash in&quot; on.  That&#39;s the difference between a dark room, and one that is specifically pointed out (via camera shot or dialog) as being Dark.  In the one case, it&#39;s scenery.  In the other case, we <i>know</i> something is going to jump out of the darkness.<br><br>So that describes situation aspects pretty well, but what about character aspects, and Create Advantage?<br><br>Well, basically the same thing.<br><br>Han Solo&#39;s meeting with Greedo?  It exists for the sole reason that we need to establish with the audience that Han Solo is actually wanted by Jabba.  That way when Jabba starts interfering later, we&#39;re not surprised.  It feels like a logical extension of what&#39;s going on.<br><br>Okay, so that&#39;s a character aspect, but how about Create Advantage?<br><br>Well, let&#39;s look at having a weak point in the armor of something.  That&#39;s common enough, right?  What happens in a TV show?  Well, one of two things happens, 99% of the time - either we see a camera shot (and when I say &quot;camera shot&quot; you should think &quot;action&quot;, unless we&#39;re talking about setting a scene or introducing a character) of the armored thing moving in a way that exposes the weak point, or we have someone shout out &quot;hey, when he does &lt;thing&gt; his armor&#39;s exposed&quot;.  This seems extraneous, and it is from a &quot;realism&quot; standpoint.  But what it does is inform the viewer of the weak point, so that when the hero takes advantage of it, it feels logical and connected rather than random.<br><br>And that&#39;s how Fate works with aspects.  Either we establish them as part of setting the scene, or we establish them as some kind of camera shot/action that informs the viewer/players of what&#39;s going on and sets up our later use of them.  And those times when something gets revealed <i>without</i> setup?  That&#39;s what Fate Points are for!<br><br>This is also a big part of why I&#39;m not a fan of hidden aspects.  If aspects are narratively established facts, and they&#39;re hidden, then they&#39;re not established!  At the minimum, the aspect should reflect the information that is available to the audience - that is, the players.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/117646243340764868749">Nathan Roberts</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MJEllis">MJ Ellis (Master MJ)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TedLeBeau">Ted LeBeau</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+VanDavis">Van Davis</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108205596744092903527">Mark Kung</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111750123454041937620">Jon Freeman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102336737082807132940">Strange Person</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108444540051543491002">Roe Portal</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106593818977986341938">Carla Lincoln (Clairefox)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/118083026924425156313">Morgan Ellis</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SergioLeRoux">Sergio Le Roux</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KirbyGehman">Kirby Gehman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114846153366524126226">Sune D.</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101947999336698012481">Wickus Booyse</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ThisIsJimTait">Jim Tait</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102203809325421269433">Toby Sennett</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108273868560636086523">dpo8bwee</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105730424784548401004">Kevin Tompos</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111021074892106600223">Bean Lucas</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JacobPoss">Jacob Possin</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DevonApple">Devon Apple</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116595171579663828830">Troy Ray</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+WinchellChung">Winchell Chung</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109141262198508604799">John Hawkins</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NicolaUrbinati">Nicola Urbinati</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ThisIsJimTait">Jim Tait</a></div></div><meta itemprop="commentCount" content="28"><div class="comments"><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/110973090768429200038" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Marshall Brengle</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T17:35:19-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102762829868917594149" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Nathan Holden</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T17:46:56-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Disagree slightly. They&#39;re possibly-narrative-effecting true facts about whatever gets the Aspect. They need not be known by the audience at the introduction, hence the Hidden Aspect. For example, imagine that you have a mine, and in it, several barrels. They could be anything. They&#39;re not labeled. PCs can make their guesses, but you mention that it could just as easily be a barrel of wine, too. After all, work in the mine is hard, and a little comfort would go a long way.<br><br>But in fact, you as the GM know that they&#39;re (probably) right: it&#39;s a barrel of powder. If they try to look inside, or if they use game mechanics to try to find a helpful Aspect in the environment, they might find out that it has the Aspect &#39;Explosive.&#39;<br><br>But if it was wine? &#39;Flammable,&#39; sure. But not &#39;Explosive.&#39; Which makes a big difference when you&#39;re deciding whether or not to light it on fire and kick it down a ramp at some bad guys, incidentally.<br><br>And all that because, all they saw were some tightly-bound oaken barrels with a plugged-up bung hole at first. It wasn&#39;t until they discovered the Aspect that the camera shot showed a little bit of powder draining very slowly out of a seam that wasn&#39;t dust-tight.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+WinchellChung" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Winchell Chung</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T17:47:59-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> thank you!

Which is fine: things can have those qualities. But there is a difference between a puzzle (the players need to use those barrels to blow up a thing I put in the adventure) and creative scene aspect use. From another perspective:<br><br>This mine has a bunch of barrels in this room. GM silently retains &quot;Bunch of Barrels&quot; as an unwritten (but not secret) Aspect, and the players likewise can take interest in the barrels, and trigger the revelation of an actual Aspect &quot;Pile of Barrels&quot;. Whether they are explosive or flammable or food, in this case, is somewhat moot until it becomes narratively important.<br><br>Now if the players later wanted to create a barricade, they already have (or can easily establish) that a Pile of Barrels is there to help build it.<br><br>The GM could then, if it comes up, hand over a Fate point and invoke the Pile of Barrels, saying &quot;you didn&#39;t know this, but the Pile of Barrels was Explosive, and that flaming arrow just set it off right in your face&quot;. The barrels were there to be investigated or ignored, and the Invoke and Fate Point are there so the GM can reveal the thing (Barrel o&#39; Explosives) while not punishing the players outright for not turning over every rock in the mine. <br><br>I had more example but need to step away.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102762829868917594149" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Nathan Holden</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T18:01:42-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> You&#39;re absolutely right about that.

But I think that&#39;s worth discussing a bit.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a level of assumption that I&#39;m saying &quot;there can be no hidden information&quot;.  That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying.  There can be tons of hidden information.  There&#39;s zero wrong with that.  Not every fact has to be shared.<br><br>The difference between a plain old ordinary fact and an aspect, in Fate terms, is two-fold.  One:  An aspect can be invoked.  Two:  An aspect can be Compelled.<br><br>That&#39;s mostly it.  So when we make something an Aspect, what we&#39;re really saying is &quot;I plan to invoke or Compel this.  Be ready.&quot;  It&#39;s the &quot;setup&quot; part of the &quot;setup/payoff&quot; structure.<br><br>So what I&#39;m really saying when I say &quot;I don&#39;t like hidden aspects&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;share everything with your players&quot;.  What I&#39;m saying is &quot;don&#39;t invoke or compel things that haven&#39;t been established&quot;.<br><br>Now, we don&#39;t get the advantage of being able to tightly script everything, so that might, to some extent, be unavoidable.  But it&#39;s a good idea, and worth striving for, because then we don&#39;t kind of break down narrative causality or, in more game-like terms, feel &quot;cheap&quot;.<br><br>So, we don&#39;t have to tell people that Bill is a vampire.  But it&#39;s worth noting that he&#39;s a Night Owl and Curiously Strong.  By giving out that information, it&#39;s a lot easier to feel &quot;fair&quot; if we compel/invoke, and also makes the players curious about exactly what the heck is up with Bill.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T18:04:45-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102762829868917594149" oid="102762829868917594149" >Nathan Holden</a></span>: A Fate Point could be used to declare that the <b><i>Unknown Contents</i></b> are, in fact, salt pork if that&#39;s what the characters happen to need ;)</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/111021074892106600223" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Bean Lucas</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T18:10:14-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-09-28T18:12:27-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102762829868917594149" oid="102762829868917594149" >Nathan Holden</a></span> Not everything that&#39;s true needs to be an aspect.<br><br>If it is not important that the contents are unknown/mysterious, then, it doesn&#39;t need to be an aspect.

Why?  A gun that&#39;s got something wrong with it not firing is pretty much a textbook example of a Compel.  Okay, I would do the Compel before Fate Points and Invokes were spent, but it&#39;s still a totally fair Compel.<br><br>It&#39;s bad form, in my opinion, not because it&#39;s a bad Compel, but because it was based on a hidden aspect.

Then it would be totally fair, IMHO.<br><br>Again, look at it as a TV show - a character throws the gun over to his friend!  But it hits the floor, and we see it get dented, or the characters wince, or something like that... we&#39;ve now been informed that the gun has had a rough time of it, so that when it doesn&#39;t fire, we don&#39;t feel cheated.  If the gun just happens to not fire without that being called out?  It feels cheap.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102762829868917594149" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Nathan Holden</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T19:07:48-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> I don&#39;t think anyone would disagree with you there.

I think the resonant point I&#39;m getting is something like &quot;if an Aspect is hidden, it&#39;s <i>not in play</i>&quot;.<br><br>And that&#39;s actually interesting to me, not just something I consider obvious.  The dungeon example is an interesting one.  I mean, if you blindside your players with a brutal trap, in some kinds of games that might feel pretty unfair.  But!  If the Aspect is, say, at the dungeon level, along the lines of <b><i>Centuries of Ancestors Didn&#39;t Want You Here</i></b>, or <b><i>Just Traps Like Whoa</i></b>, well, different story.<br><br>So your core point, exemplified by the Geysers, points to an idea that if you have something hidden it should be something that&#39;s really not in the game right now.  Sure in the bossfight, this lady is going to be an <b><i>Ancient White Vampire</i></b>, but right now she&#39;s just <b><i>Super Pale</i></b> and <b><i>Disquietingly Sensual</i></b>.  And all of that is justified by the campaign aspect <b><i>Vampires Like Ants On Candy</i></b>.  It&#39;s hidden state, but it&#39;s fair hidden state.<br><br>I feel like there are tricky corner cases hiding here, but in terms of guide posts for new players I think you captured some important ideas.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102824793989809243939" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Malcolm Reynolds</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T21:07:40-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">On the issue of hidden aspects, what works better is to have aspects that are only partially true rather than to have them completely true and hidden. <br><br>As an example, in a murder mystery, the aspect that a particular person is suspicious, like &quot;no alibi&quot; or &quot;had motive&quot; should be introduced early in the story. The key to a good mystery is that the cards are on the table, but that the detective and audience doesn&#39;t realize it until later. When those two are one and the same, it is even more true. A mystery in which the detective has information the audience does not cannot work here at all. <br><br>When using aspects for a mystery, you can also change them to represent new evidence.&quot;No alibi&quot; can be upgraded to &quot;Observed fleeing the scene of the crime&quot; or inverted to instead say &quot;His true alibi was that he was sleeping with the victim&#39;s wife at the time of the killing.&quot; Something that ironically both makes him appear more suspicious as well as entirely proves his innocence. <br><br>Even if we are talking about the pure shock value of hidden details, it is still better if were are expecting something, even if we don&#39;t know what that is. Tension is all about buildup, and there can&#39;t be buildup if the heroes aren&#39;t expecting something. Misdirection is even fine, but there needs to be an idea something is there. That something should be an aspect so that it can be compelled or invoked. <br><br></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-28T22:25:00-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102762829868917594149" oid="102762829868917594149" >Nathan Holden</a></span>:<br><br>What I&#39;m kind of suggesting is that if it isn&#39;t revealed it&#39;s not really an aspect.

All this explains why I think Fate is wasted on the Storygames crowd! ;-) Seriously, none of the above means &quot;and therefore you have to have a shared narrative game where everyone is a co gm and has co created everything&quot; or &quot;and therefore everything your character can do should be defined by Aspects.&quot; Spiderman&#39;s weird, guilt-driven drive is modeled well as an aspect, but there&#39;s no reason his webbing ability has to be (though it&#39;s effect can be).</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-29T12:41:51-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117174326596748903505" oid="117174326596748903505" >Gary Furash</a></span>:  I totally agree.  While Fate certainly can be played in hardcore &quot;shared narrative&quot; mode, it can also be played much closer to a traditional game.  Neither way is, in my mind, &quot;doing it wrong&quot;.<br><br>Spiderman&#39;s webbing probably doesn&#39;t need an explicit aspect.  You can have aspect-based permission, which still matches the &quot;model&quot; of narrative causality - we&#39;re not surprised when Bill shoots a fireball because it&#39;s been established that he&#39;s a wizard.  Similarly, we&#39;re not surprised when Spiderman shoots webs because he&#39;s, well, Spiderman.  It could also easily be a stunt.  But I wouldn&#39;t require &quot;shoots webs&quot; as an aspect.<br><br>In another comment somewhere I talked about separating abilities into three parts:<br><br>1) How they work &quot;in universe&quot;<br>2) How they impact the narrative<br>3) Costing for the sake of balance<br><br>How they impact the narrative is obvious - you shoot stuff, and you can stick bad guys to things.  And since you&#39;d already have to buy the appropriate skills, those don&#39;t really seem worthy of additional costs to me, though you could argue for the web-based movement as a stunt, I think.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/111750123454041937620" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jon Freeman</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-09-30T15:15:35-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-09-30T15:16:25-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">In my 80s action movie game, Fate points were playing cards that had an additional narrative function, as well as being spent as Fate points they could be used to create an additional effect, which I suppose is really a  &quot;pop-up&quot; aspect... giving everyone the chance to make the &quot;surprise reveal&quot; of new information.
