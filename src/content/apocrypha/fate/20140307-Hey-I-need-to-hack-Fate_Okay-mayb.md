I&#39;ve often seen this with magic systems, for example, which have some sort of mana/casting stress/backlash or other kind of system, not because the narrative supports it, but thats how magic is most often balanced in other games, and people feel like magic has to have something like it. The same trap lurks for many other things, and it&#39;s important to ask yourself if you are implementing a rule because it makes sense, or because all other systems you know do it like that.<br><br>tl/dr: &quot;fiction first&quot; ;)</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-03-07T18:01:57-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I&#39;d also point out here that this is the approach I&#39;d use for <b>Fate</b>.  Not necessarily other games.  But the &quot;fiction, not physics&quot; approach that the Fate rules take makes it a good fit.<br><br>For something like Savage Worlds or GURPS I&#39;d recommend another approach.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-03-07T18:43:39-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I am particularly curious about &quot;hacks&quot; that are simply implementations of the rules as applied to different settings.
