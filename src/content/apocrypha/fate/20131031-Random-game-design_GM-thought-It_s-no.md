styles of play.  DragonLance is an obvious early example, and many organized play modules follow that pattern.<br><br>The result of this has been a shift away from players making larger-scale in-game decisions - where to go, what to do, etc.  Strategizing and scouting are de-emphasized by this style of play.<br><br>So, if my hypothesis is correct, this would lead to an overall decreased level of cognitive load - players having lost decision making capabilities in terms of the direction of the game.  So, my hypothesis would then predict that this cognitive load would be increased in other areas - and indeed, over this time period the game systems have become more &#39;crunchy&#39; and detailed, both in terms of play and character build.  This may of course be a coincidence, but it&#39;s consistent with what the hypothesis would predict.<br><br>A bit of possibly more useful Fate-related fallout from this is pretty simple - since Fate is, mechanically, a very simple game, the cognitive load for players has to come from areas besides the game mechanics.  In other words, the player has to be given dilemmas, or interesting plot-related situations, and needs to have a greater influence on what happens to make up for the reduced mechanical grit.<br><br>An interesting case study of this is FAE Pathfinder.  While I&#39;m generally skeptical of attribute+skill systems, or &quot;crunchier&quot; Fate in general, FAE:PF&#39;s goal is explicitly to enable the usage of Paizo materials, including Adventure Paths.  Because of this, and the lower levels of agency typical of module series like Adventure Paths, the cognitive load has to be made up somehow or the game will be very, very boring.  In this case, increasing the mechanical &quot;crunch&quot; - the cognitive load from the system mechanics side - is absolutely the right thing to do.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/113372252094304966759">Lincoln Shone</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SheaValentine">Shea Valentine</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112980421781835714536">Adam Goldberg</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TomTysonbluetyson">Blue Tyson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan">Teo Morgan</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115091275373780411956">Frank Falkenberg (Zornhau)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GaryAnastasio">Gary Anastasio</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MikeLindsey">Mike Lindsey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115484991119248632805">Brett Bowen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117432417897461847475">Joshua O&#39;Kelley</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MikeLindsey">Mike Lindsey</a></div></div><meta itemprop="commentCount" content="29"><div class="comments"><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+MarkDiazTruman" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Mark Diaz Truman</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-10-31T17:44:32-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">/sub</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RowanCota" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Chloe CD</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-10-31T18:22:51-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">This is interesting.

In games of Fate that I run it isn&#39;t so much that everyone feels like they understand the system, but that whether they do, or don&#39;t, what they say might matter. That keeps them engaged in a way that even something like Microlite20 doesn&#39;t seem to.<br><br>I credit this, in a big way, to the choice of using words instead of numbers to convey information. Basically, anything you say, or write can be seen in Fate terms by literate Fate players without you even trying to convert it.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/105819537446550907330" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Porter Williams</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-10-31T20:55:22-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I think thy it&#39;s worth pointing out that not only do some players have different load ranges, or preferences for types A and R, but they might handle each type better.

If the game has an engaging plot, then I&#39;m willing to put a lot of energy into that aspect of the game. If I find that the plot is uninteresting, then there had better be other aspects of the he game that hold my interest.<br><br>Likewise, the amount of brain power I&#39;m willing to invest in the mechanics of a system depend on how engaging those mechanics are. Personally, If the rules offer a lot of tactical options and meaningful decision making, I&#39;m willing to deal with more complexity. If it&#39;s just complexity for complexity&#39;s sake, then I&#39;m less willing to engage.<br><br>While there is a maximum limit to the amount of energy that I&#39;m willing to put into a game--that&#39;s not usually the limiting factor, especially when I&#39;m a player. I will typically hit the limits of the game&#39;s ability to engage me well before I redline my mental engine. As a GM, however, I&#39;m much more likely to be running close to my mental limits. <br><br>Also, people will find different aspects of play more engaging than others. This leads to preferences for different types of systems. <br><br>And, at a certain level, game mechanics and plot are at least somewhat mutually exclusive. If I spend two hours running through a tactically complex combat scenario, I&#39;m probably not going to have enough time to make the plot very engaging.<br><br>Likewise, if I&#39;m engaged with the plot, I might resent anything that slows the plot down. I may want fast, light combat, because the important questions (What price are you willing to pay to get what you want? What effect does this fight have on the rest of the world? Etc.) aren&#39;t typically answered by a detailed blow-by-blow tactical exercise.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-11-01T08:37:49-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Plot, most basically put, is what is happening. A tactically sloggy scene is just a macro shot of plot. I suppose that&#39;s what make me still like them. I suppose the thing I like about Fate is that a shite plot can be spiced up by everyone at the table. Nobody is trapped, as in other systems, or by other GMs conditioned by systems that imply (I say that because few explicitly say a player can&#39;t do such things) a firm line between the authority of the GM vs. players.<br><br>I&#39;ve always seen an engaging plot as being as much the responsibility of the players as mine though.

However, this clearly isn&#39;t always the case. <br><br>I&#39;ve played in a number of games where other players have gotten upset because I deliberately made bad tactical decisions--just because that&#39;s what my character would have done in that situation (either because of limited information--e.g. not acting on player knowledge that the character does not have, or because of his motivation in that particular scene).<br><br>One of the things I like about Fate is that it can actually reward this sort of play through compels. Yes, you may make a tactically bad choice--but you get a fate point for it. With creative use of scene aspects, you can even reward a player for ignoring player knowledge and making a bad decision based strictly on character knowledge (e.g. compel a &quot;fog of war&quot; situational aspect).<br><br>Part of what I was getting at is also that time acts as a limiting resource. And there&#39;s an interesting relationship between time and engagement. In order to be engaging, you must invest time in a particular element--and the more engaging an element is, the more willing people are to invest their time.<br><br>Again, one of the thing Fate gets right is that mechanical elements are usually only important if they are also narratively important. That means we are more likely to spend our time on scenes that are both mechanically and narratively interesting.<br><br>Or, to put it another way, we don&#39;t need to waste time looking through long lists of possible modifiers trying to determine if any apply, or considering a long list of special-case rules.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-11-01T10:10:32-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Fair enough, I do think that even using Fate we could get bogged way down in tactical choices if we so chose, but point taken. The whole experience is more express, because of the system being hewn down to a sort of Universal Theory of Gaming.<br><br>I appreciate that the rules of Fate (often seen as simple) are flexible enough to cover different instances of contested happenings in way that makes fluency nearly complete among my players (usually the stuff they don&#39;t know is a house rule I made up). Still, in my experience, the time that is taken up in other games is often not the tactical choices being made, but the relearning, teaching, interpretation, and argumentation that goes into those choices, and administrating the outcomes of them.<br><br>That brings me to the fact that many people actually enjoy all those things that I see as hindrances to game progression. They may like the argument, and manipulation of the rules to their ends, whether it&#39;s in good faith, or not, and I suspect not a few of the people I stopped playing with presented false reasons for disliking Fate.<br><br>More bluntly: universal literacy combined with distributed authority means certain people can&#39;t cheat, or rely on favoritism anymore.<br><br>Another thing to consider (perhaps), games like Fate, Risus, and others that are very easy to pick up allow for a more dynamic line up of players. The group can shift membership very easily, most especially with people that are already literate. In great part I think this is because the culture of Fate (and Risus) is written into the rules. <br><br>The flip side of compact systems is that people who like to learn new things may feel they already know all there is to know about the game.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RichWarren" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rich Warren</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-11-01T10:56:58-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117281067526668029159" oid="117281067526668029159" >Teo Tayobobayo</a></span>, the point about rules literacy is important. I had assumed we were talking about players who were already reasonably literate--or supportive environments where other players/GMs help others with the rules.
