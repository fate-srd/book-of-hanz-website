I would simply go along with the narrative. In my mind, this is very similar to the guidelines of &quot;if there is nothing interesting that can happen based on failure and success, don&#39;t roll dice&quot; (paraphrasing). There is no point rolling to see how well a guillotine attacks a character... if the character&#39;s head is in the guillotine, and the blade drops, that&#39;s all she wrote. Sneak up on a sleeping sentry and slit a throat, don&#39;t roll the attack. It&#39;s about the same as trying to open an unlocked, unblocked, unstuck, un-trapped door. The outcome is obvious, and if there&#39;s no interesting result for success AND fail, then there&#39;s no real point in wasting the time to roll.<br><br>All that said, I still maintain that PC&#39;s (and possibly key NPCs... possibly) should rarely be forced to accept death as the only answer. PC death is disruptive to the story, and to the players. I&#39;m not suggesting that there shouldn&#39;t be consequences... but PC death is rarely a positive thing. Of course, everyone&#39;s table is different, and if everyone knows that character mortality is a real risk then that&#39;s a different story. :)</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/103419087684257557026" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Arlo Evans</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-05-19T18:40:01-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">&quot;There is no chance of a miss.  There is no chance of the person dodging.  The angle of the shot is such that a deflection is impossible.  The &#39;victim&#39; has no supernatural powers, armor, or anything else.  Any Compels will be refused, so no &#39;last minute backup&#39; to save them.&quot;<br><br>This sounds like you have already decided, so what mechanics are there, other than describing the death, perhaps.<br><br>If the GM wants a different result, there are always ways out.

The entire jiggered context given is rather pointless - even as an exercise. By the narrative the answer is already determined. You have left no room for fiction except the one outcome. So, what is the point of allowing anything else to happen? If there is only one outcome there is no point in engaging any mechanics - it just happens. The game system used is completely independent of the straw man.<br><br>If it has already been decided and nothing short of the collapse of the known universe can stop it then it falls into the realm of the uninteresting.

TBH, any role-playing characters should be that way - Fate just calls it out in the base rules.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-05-19T22:50:16-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Well, that&#39;s kind of the core of the question.  Some people will insist that if you shoot someone in the back of a head with a crossbow in D&amp;D, that you still roll for damage.  Or if you try to chop off someone&#39;s head with a sword with them helpless, you still roll damage.  Etc.<br><br>So while it seems kind of pointless to you (and I&#39;d handle it the same way) it&#39;s not pointless to <b>everyone</b>.  I was kind of curious where Fate players/GMs fell on that spectrum.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/115619263638847799523" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Eric Tolle</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-05-20T01:40:03-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Honestly, it depends on how we get to the situation where a gun is put to someone&#39;s head. If you mean, would I let someone roll really well on Stealth and then auto-kill someone, then probably not. Unless it&#39;s a poor nameless minion, in case why are we wasting the time making a big production of it? Or it could be the end result of a long contest where someone completely refuses to take concessions, in which case that&#39;s what the player or referee wanted. Context means everything- give me the context, and I&#39;ll give you my ruling.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/109135887757310189227" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Alexander Keane</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-05-20T08:05:09-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Another idea I just had about this situation is that it can also turn into an &quot;If you strike me down, I will only become more powerful&quot; moment.
