It&#39;s one of those things that tells us what players want in a game. If a player isn&#39;t seeing something they want, of course they can mention that to the GM. However, being proactive is good. If we expect it of the characters, shouldn&#39;t we also expect it of the players (counting the GM as a player). Furthermore, these are tools we can use. And, it&#39;s not that I would expect anyone to always keep track of all these things. However, to have them laid out before them and even scan over them for how they could be used. they&#39;re useful tools and it&#39;s good to have the toolbox open and accessible. Now, I haven&#39;t run into &quot;problems.&quot; I have seen ways the game could be enhanced by having these things readily at hand and in mind.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-07-23T15:45:24-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Right, and as a player, I generally keep my aspects in mind, and then maybe a few situational aspects.<br><br>And as a GM, I try to make a point of periodically going &quot;hrm, is there anything I can compel here&quot; and glancing over the list.<br><br>BTW, I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m just trying to put out my view of it, and understand yours a bit more.  I do agree that some kind of reference on the aspects (be it 3X5s, a whiteboard, or a virtual playmat) is pretty much indispensable.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+CameronCorniuk" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Cameron Corniuk</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-07-23T15:45:25-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I&#39;d also like to point out that I&#39;m not saying there are too many aspects, just something I&#39;ve heard repeated several times.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-07-23T15:46:32-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Fair &#39;nuff - and I&#39;m just trying to understand the statement a bit more, since it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve personally ever felt, as a player or as a GM... perhaps slightly more as a GM, but never as a player.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+CameronCorniuk" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Cameron Corniuk</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-07-23T15:48:36-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Yeah, that&#39;s why I am making note of it, as hopefully some of the people who do normally run into this or find it to be a problem can speak up.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Fred Hicks</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-07-23T16:03:36-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">In a 4 player game I &quot;track&quot; at most 12 aspects.
