I&#39;ve had lots more luck using extra minions to help differentiate the opposition and make the fight a little more dynamic. Or the &quot;big bad is multiple zones big&quot; option, which also works.<br><br>I&#39;m curious how <i>War of Ashes</i> handles this, as that game takes a more tactical slant to Fate, but I haven&#39;t looked at the playtest yet.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Paul Kießhauer</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-06-17T14:16:19-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">A single character with a number of actions equal to the players can be devastating.

by performing actions that would prevent the NPC from doing anything (think Spiderman and &quot;caught in a web&quot;).<br><br>You&#39;d definitely have to build NPCs built in this way differently - a +1 to &quot;peak&quot; would probably be more appropriate in most cases.  And it certainly might be worth looking at giving the NPC a number of actions that&#39;s somewhat lower than the number of PCs - as I said, &quot;actions = number of guys on the other side&quot; was mostly just a starting point.<br><br>As far as it not &quot;being appropriate&quot; for some NPCs, I disagree.  An action isn&#39;t a unit of time, it&#39;s a measure of &quot;camera focus&quot;.  I could certainly imagine in a movie a major villain being given time to do more than one &#39;thing&#39;

I&#39;m talking of course about 4th edition D&amp;D.<br><br>It&#39;s solo monsters act as multiple baddies for climatic fights in a few different ways:<br><br>1. Special attacks/defenses/what have you that don&#39;t take actions.<br>2. Being able to take additional actions each turn.<br>4.

Here are some ideas:<br><br>1. Giving the NPC a free Create Advantage when certain circumstances come up.<br><br>So to use Rob&#39;s example of Magneto, maybe Magneto gets to Create Advantage using his magnetic control powers without using an action whenever a PC attacks &quot;alone&quot; (without using an Advantage representing teamwork).<br><br>2. Giving the NPC a &quot;free attack&quot; or create advantage at the beginning of the Conflict.<br><br>Perhaps Maxine, the vampire monarch of Seattle gets to start off any Conflict with a free Provoke roll. She&#39;s crazy scary.<br><br>3. Giving the NPC an additional action when they&#39;re on the ropes (when they take a Consequence, when half their stress boxes are filled up).<br><br>Badly wounding a dragon drives it into a berserk fury. When it takes a Consequence because of Physical stress it gets a free Attack action on it&#39;s turn.<br><br>4. As a last resort, just giving the NPC additional actions can serve so long as it makes sense in the fiction.<br><br>An Ettin might be stupid, but two heads are better than one. It gets double the normal number of actions each of it&#39;s turns.<br><br>Those ideas, used individually or together might improve the threat &quot;boss&quot; NPCs pose on their own without making such characters a &quot;nuclear option&quot;.<br><br>Just a thought.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-06-19T15:40:32-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/114357509183316569561" oid="114357509183316569561" >Jack Gulick</a></span>:  Hadn&#39;t thought about the PCs wanting to get in on the multiple action action.  That&#39;s a very valid point.<br><br>I think that&#39;s part of why I wanted to originally tie it to number of participants - it creates a rule that can easily work both for or against the players.  It also allows gang-up bonuses to still work, while de-emphasizing the absolutely crushing nature of the action economy.  A three-on-one fight would still be clearly balanced in favor of the three, due to both potential gang-up bonuses as well as the fact that the &quot;one&quot; side has a single stress track.<br><br>In some ways, it&#39;s kind of like *World, in that enemy actions are directly tied to PC actions (thanks for reminding me of that, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112236017611575207167" oid="112236017611575207167" >Christopher Stilson</a></span>).<br><br>I dunno, I&#39;m gonna chew on it for a bit and may experiment.  I think limiting it to one <b>attack</b> per actual combatant would be a good idea, to say the least.<br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117874391384150575536" oid="117874391384150575536" >John Jessop</a></span>:  I don&#39;t know how I feel about introduce &#39;interrupt&#39; style stuff.  Allowing for some effect on a success with style on defense is an interesting option, but it still kind of ignores the potential action lock potential of being outnumbered.<br><br>And it&#39;s no longer FATE.

You&#39;re getting the benefits of giving a BBEG multiple actions without the potential mechanical complications (such as encouraging the baddy to focus fire on PCs).<br><br>Using specific interrupt conditions also allows you to drive home what a particular baddie is good at.

This gives them a certain amount of action points, along with an elite action list that is tailored to the monster. By spending a certain amount of points, they may take one of their elite actions outside of their own turn, between other people&#39;s turns. They regain their action points on their own turn.<br><br>For instance, take some sort of combat specialist solo boss character you want to run. Give him an action point pool of 3 to represent he&#39;s of fairly high standard, but nothing monstrously high. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s an agile combatant archetype, and give him 2 heroic actions to showcase this. Quick Strike (2 points): perform a melee attack; and Agile Combatant (1 point): Create an Advantage using athletics or another movement based skill.<br><br>Putting this guy in an encounter, you&#39;d play his turn as normal. Then a PC gets to go, attacks the guy. That shows your NPC that perhaps where he is standing right now isn&#39;t the safest place, so he spends 1 of his heroic action points to dodge away and climb on a roof, creating an advantage. Now the situation has changed before the next player&#39;s turn, making the fight much more dynamic even though there&#39;s only one opponent. He could use his 2 remaining points to whack someone trying to follow him up, or he could continue to make it hard on them in other ways, continuously relocating, perhaps luring them where he needs them for when he sees his chance (his turn comes up).<br><br>I believe this has many advantages on simply giving an opponent X actions where X is the number of PCs. For one, lets say my character is, for whatever reason, not for useful in combat at all. Normally, I don&#39;t feel bad for being in a combat, as I can just do whatever I want. Even if I don&#39;t manage to help us win, I don&#39;t push us towards losing. The proposed system would, however, give the boss NPC an extra action because I&#39;m there. And he&#39;s actually competent. My team has less chance to win because they brought someone extra along. It feels wrong to me. Even for a party that&#39;s all combat focused, it still feels very odd that every new party member you add reduces your own actions proportional to the NPC.<br><br>You&#39;d also have to come up with rules so it doesn&#39;t end up being X attacks against 1 PC, of course.<br><br>These problems don&#39;t come up nearly as much with the elite actions idea. You get extra actions, but they&#39;re not tied to the amount of PCs, but only to the quality of the NPC. It doesn&#39;t feel like the PC are doing it to themselves at that point. You also can easily limit the pool of available actions, so the &quot;attack one guy 4 times&quot; stops being an issue. On top of that, the players don&#39;t know when the big bad will take an action. He might do it just before your turn, but he also might not. This, in my opinion, makes it feel even more dynamic than if he has multiple turns, but you clearly know when they&#39;re coming up.<br><br>Just something that popped up in my head and I ended up writing out far lengthier than I should have.</div></div></div></body></html>
