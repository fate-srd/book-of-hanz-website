 They&#39;ve definitely expressed interest in playing a regular Fate game.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JBBell">JB Bell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BryanThrall">Bryan Thrall</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BillCollins">Bill Collins</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SophieLagace">Sophie Lagace</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JacobPoss">Jacob Possin</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111586412879869935960">Paul Arezina</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan">Teo Morgan</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576">Paul Kießhauer</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamSchwaninger">Adam Schwaninger</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks">Fred Hicks</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115484991119248632805">Brett Bowen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117432417897461847475">Joshua O&#39;Kelley</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JonathanDietrich">Jonathan C.
