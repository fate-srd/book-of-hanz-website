either.  It just seems like the first six or so episodes of any TV series are about establishing characters and relationships, and that the show really takes off after that.<br><br>And I&#39;m wondering if framing the stories in terms of &quot;early episodes&quot; might have some value in terms of helping both define kind of a shape for those stories, make them have more potentially relevant information, help bring about more table consensus on the direction of the game, etc.<br><br>I also think it&#39;s probably a bit closer to the SotC &quot;first novel&quot; idea in some ways than many of the stories I&#39;ve gotten in practice, many of which are just vignettes, and really have no &#39;story structure&#39; whatsoever - which is fine, but those often don&#39;t really give much in the way of ongoing threads.<br><br>And there&#39;s no reason an &quot;episode&quot; couldn&#39;t be a flashback, either :)<br><br>It&#39;s not a drastic change that I&#39;m talking about here so much as a slightly different framing.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JackGulick" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jack Gulick</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T17:24:23-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Consider the structure of Firefly, which actually has two pilot episodes because of Fox TV silliness...<br><br>It&#39;s more traditional &quot;we all meet up&quot;
