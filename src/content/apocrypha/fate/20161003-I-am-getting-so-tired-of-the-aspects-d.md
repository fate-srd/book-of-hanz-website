What takes aspects out of gimmick territory for me is seeing how some of my players missed them when we switched one of our games to another system that kept the &quot;spend a point for a bonus&quot; mechanic. They missed having clear prompts on their character sheets to remind them off what drives and colors their characters (which is different from &quot;what my character is good at&quot;). And combat became a bit more rote when we lacked prompts on the table for interesting features in the scene you can use to your advantage, especially for a group that came from D&amp;D and was used to having such things illustrated before them with maps and minis. <br><br>Now, that&#39;s not to say that group never had problems with aspects (they did), nor even that everyone in it likes Fate (one of them really dislikes it for reasons I still don&#39;t quite get) ... but it did get me thinking about what aspects do. I think D&amp;D 5e has an interesting approach in basically having character aspects (background, ideals, books, flaw) that can earn you a fate point (inspiration), but aren&#39;t referred to at all to spend that bonus. It kind of shows how aspects do something even when you don&#39;t or even can&#39;t invoke them. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T10:47:19-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I tend to play with various sorts of Aspects, so some are going to be persistent, while others may be highly variable, or indeed do need to be paid for to be active. <br><br><i>Sword Master</i> is an example of an Aspect I would assume is always on, but not always affecting die rolls.

Though that is a bit of a downside, the upside is that since their sword is a part of them, I would treat it like one of their limbs, so if someone touched it, I might make them detecting that automatic, whereas the <i>Sword Master</i> might have to make a check to see if someone was swiping their sword. <br><br>So, I suppose I see it as Aspects having some constant, and some variable effects.<br><br>Is this also seen as misconception?

I think these might be points that actually have dissed your gruntle :)<br><br>As I said in my last post, I think aspects primarily represent narrative &quot;cause&quot;, allowing narrative effects to happen.  If we haven&#39;t established <b><i>Crazy Ass Geysers</i></b> on a planet, then it feels cheap when one goes off right underneath the Milano.<br><br>Character aspects also act as prompts from the player as to what they want to see in a game.  When a player has the aspect <b><i>The Black Society Is After Me</i></b> you know they want the Black Society (whatever that is) to muck with them.<br><br>And, narrating how invokes happen certainly has value to me.  Yeah, you could do that without aspects, but it provides a nice prompt.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a huge difference in how people look at games.  If you view the imagined world as the &quot;main&quot; thing, and what people describe in it, then I think Aspects work and are useful and interesting.  If you view the underlying numbers as model as the &quot;real&quot; thing, then I think they&#39;re less interesting, and I honestly don&#39;t think Fate will be a very satisfying game.<br><br>The real &quot;aspects only count if invoked&quot; argument I was referring to is saying things like &quot;If you are <b><i>In Cover</i></b>, it does nothing unless you spend a Fate Point&quot;.  Which is just false.<br><br></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T11:30:10-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">And, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117281067526668029159" oid="117281067526668029159" >T to the E to the O</a></span>, I&#39;d agree that it could use some more clarification in the text.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanMDanks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ryan M.

Honestly, I think that the presence of Skills in Fate Core contributes to this misconception. As I see it, Aspects set expectations, establish the tableau of a given scene, and provide justifications for actions; Skills are just labeled bonuses that reinforce Aspects and should not themselves provide justifications for taking actions. <br><br>I don&#39;t justify shooting you because I have the Skill Shoot +2; I justify shooting you because of the emerging narrative, and my character&#39;s place in it based upon their own Aspects, and the other Aspects currently in the scene...when I do so I get to add my relevant Skill bonus to the check. <br><br>I prefer skill-less Fate, or a version of Fate where Skills are doing something else interesting like Atomic Robo&#39;s modes because I think they get in the way more often than not and take the focus off of Aspects, which to me is one of the strongest parts of Fate and a primary reason for using it. There are lots of Skill based games around, and in that pool taken as a Skill based game Fate isn&#39;t particularly compelling. However taken on its strengths as a narrative game backed with a very strong and elegant action and resolution system, it shines as one of the best game systems of all time (IMO).<br><br>Putting myself in the shoes of someone who doesn&#39;t already &quot;get it&quot; and is coming at Fate from a simulationist or gamist background, I see a familiar thing (a Skill list) with mechanical bonuses associated with it...very much in line with what I would expect to see. Then there&#39;s this other soft squishy stuff about &quot;Aspects&quot; that have a mechanical benefit sometimes but only by spending a very limited resource...which seems LESS good than a flat bonus that always works when it applies at no such cost. But the rules strongly express the idea that Aspects matter a lot. Cognitive Dissonance sets in...if Aspects are such a main thing, why don&#39;t they ALWAYS apply a bonus when relevant? From a simulationist / gamist background, this just does not compute. Remove Skills from the equation and the focus of the system on Aspects and their relationship with the narrative becomes much more clear.<br></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T12:39:12-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-03T12:46:39-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> then why people keep pushing all these Skill-less and Approach-based games?

Well, in Fate, you don&#39;t even note that on your sheet. You only note stats that are so bad, or good that they are going to matter, and them being particularly good, bad, or just true is going to open up other options, the way class, and race do in D&amp;D.&quot;<br><br>Stunts = Feats, and special abilities unique to your character.<br><br>Skills = Proficiencies, while<br>Approaches are roughly like the set stats of D&amp;D. <br><br>Stress = HP, roughly, but is more temporary, and perhaps even more similar to SDC from Paladium, or Vitality from SW d20.<br><br>Consequences = Aspects that describe some sort of injury, or affect that persists upon the PC, and needs to be treated, or solved to go away. <br><br>After that speech, D&amp;D literate people seem to get it, but they still have trouble with Fate Points, because nothing in D&amp;D is in the sort of Quantum Flux that exists in Fate, or rather, when it is, you roll a die rather than spend anything you&#39;ve suffered to collect. <br><br>So, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span>, I generally don&#39;t speak of the Fate Point Economy to my players, because it makes things less, rather than more understandable, but what do you prefer, and do you have any advice about addressing how foreign that part of the game is? I used to except it was just a &quot;love it, or leave it&quot; thing, but I&#39;m now feeling that it&#39;d be pretty easy to have a polyhedral associated with each Aspect, or Consequence, and when it mattered, roll that.

So, when I used to read posts on the community, everyone would be talking about how to climb a wall, because they couldn&#39;t connect that that was an Overcome action.

You generally express your narrative control via the lens of your character&#39;s defined concept and any circumstantial things emerging from the game as it is played from scene to scene, act to act.<br><br>To keep things fair and balanced, the GM has also given up some of their traditional authority and plays by similar rules, and thus works within the system via compels and invocations just as a Player does. The GM&#39;s latitude to run the game comes largely from not being limited to having one character to act as the lens of their narrative control, and having an unlimited budget for compels (but not invocations). This creates a dynamic, called the Fate Point economy, that is quite effective at propelling a group of PC&#39;s forward into the narrative when used properly. <br><br>A given group / GM can of course do something similar in any game because a narrative focus is at its essence a function of the interplay between a group of Players and a GM rather than being based on a ruleset or mechanic, and can thus be accomplished more or less with any rpg, though some are more suited to it than others and perhaps even have a loosely defined &quot;plot point&quot; or &quot;hero point&quot; sort of mechanic. <br><br>However, because Fate formalizes narrative control via Aspects and the Fate point economy into its core mechanics, rather than leaving it largely undefined to be resolved via fiat, other rules can be written to directly interact as part of a coherent system.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s not a pithy answer, but I believe it to be true. <br><br>As you say the objection was resolved, at least some of your players must have come around to favor Fate eventually?  ;)</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T13:20:11-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I definitely prefer story tied Aspects, because they are less prone to conflict like that.<br><br>Super Strong maybe more suited to being a Stunt, in a Supers game. <br><br>Once it&#39;s an Aspect, it becomes relative. <br><br>So, Solar Powered Alien as the Aspect, and Super Strong as the Stunt.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanMDanks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ryan M.

And in that model, if that&#39;s how the supers of that setting are defined, then it all makes sense and will work out in play.<br><br>But if one of the players decides to double down and starts embellishing their &quot;Super Strength&quot; with hard mechanical bonuses such as Stunts, and another player who&#39;s character is supposed to be super strong doesn&#39;t do so...in a head to head encounter the second player is depending almost entirely on their stack of available Fate Points and their ability to draw compels onto themselves to compete in the &quot;super strong&quot; narrative space with the min / maxed guy.<br><br>This may or may not be a problem, depending on a variety of factors including role overlap, PvP vs PvE, and whether the outcomes are being determined via Conflict, Challenge, Contest, or narration. Not necessarily a real issue in actual play, despite the obvious player concerns to the contrary.<br><br>I think some of this can be addressed just by shaping a better Aspect in the first place. Rather than the humdrum &quot;Super Strength&quot;, perhaps something more evocative such as Gamma-powered Pulverizer, or Mutated Might, or The Strength of Atlas, etc...something more tied into the character&#39;s back story and concept and less anchored on a gamist expression of effect. <br><br>There are a lot of soft, difficult to quantify qualia for taking this approach, but in the context of the &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have to spend a Fate point to make my Super Strength relevant&quot; argument, a differently worded concept based Aspect makes it more clear what is going on... &quot;Because of my Mutated Might, it makes sense that I can move this heavy thing&quot; rather than &quot;Because I am supposed to be Super Strong, I have to spend this Fate point to move this heavy thing?&quot;. Despite being nothing more than semantically different, semantics is the source of many an argument and misconception.<br><br>Another key point is, you DON&#39;T have to spend a Fate point to &quot;activate  your Super Strength&quot; Aspect. That is quite the wrong way to look at it. Because the character has Super Strength as an Aspect, they can justify changing the narrative in various ways based upon applying their Super Strength to the scene. No Fate point necessary, the character can justify taking a Attack, Defend, Overcome, or most notably Create Advantage action* to impact the narrative in some way using their Super Strength. <br><br>After they have rolled, the player can also spend a Fate point to either re-roll the roll or gain a bonus. This isn&#39;t a penalty (spending a limited resources), it is a benefit ( I have a way to not let my character&#39;s concept get crapped on by a bad die roll ).  <br><br><br><br><br><br>* and this is one of those places that I think Skills interfere with Aspects the most...looking at the Skill lists in Fate Core, certain Skills only allow certain Actions, and there is an implication that to take an Action, I must do it via a Skill. This is, IMO, a mistake and one of the reasons I prefer FAE as written over Fate Core as written.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanMDanks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ryan M.

That&#39;s what stunts are for, or just buying higher levels of a skill/approach.<br><br>In most games, your &quot;effectiveness&quot; is your skill + your stats + any appropriate edges/etc.  Fate is more direct - you just buy your &quot;skill&quot; (and Fate skills aren&#39;t actually skills) up to the level  you want, and justify that however you want in terms of <b>why</b> your character is a badass at fighting or whatever.<br><br>That&#39;s a huge shift.<br><br>I also don&#39;t think that Skills vs. Approaches is that big of a difference, once you grok Fate.  I think the problem is that a lot of people come to Fate with the idea of &quot;list-based gaming&quot;, and so see a list of skill-like things as &quot;here&#39;s what you can do,&quot; which isn&#39;t really how I see the intent.  The advantage of Approaches, in this case, is that you basically <b>can&#39;t</b> do that.

As others have pointed out, there are far more facts established in any gaming session than are granted Aspect status, and, of those, a subset will come into play in ways that meaningfully impact the story.  Whenever Fate Points change hands, it represents an Aspect becoming more important for the direction of the story.<br><br>Invokes represent situation trees, where normally things would go down one way, but instead, because of (Aspect), the story takes place in a way that is more in line with the Fate-point-spender&#39;s vision of how things ought to go down.  Having a limited pool of Fate Points available to each individual at the game table (except the GM for compels) isn&#39;t about saying that the characters are only conditionally who they are or conditionally awesome, it&#39;s about achieving a degree of balance in who gets to shape the narrative.  I think the best analogous system that most gamer&#39;s from all systems know and accept is turn taking during conflicts.  It&#39;s a construct that is there to make sure that everyone has an equitable opportunity to act and make something happen.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T14:38:27-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">With Invokes, specifically, I also don&#39;t see a single action as representing a &quot;single action&quot;.  I see it as representing a shot sequence.  Invoking an aspect allows you to extend that sequence out further, adding appropriate narration and details.  Tha&#39;ts the heart of the ellipsis trick, right?  You narrate a situation where it looks like the outcome is decided, but then additional invokes can be used to add additional things and make the sequence go your way.<br><br>In most games, those would be attempted to be modeled as discrete actions on separate turns.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+EdHastingsKillerShrike" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ed Hastings (Killer Shrike)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T14:41:42-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/108546067488075210468" oid="108546067488075210468" >Robert Hanz</a></span> Agreed.<br><br>To my perspective, mechanically, both Fate Core Skills and FAE Approaches are just a flat bonus to a 4dF roll with a label attached to it that suggests when it is appropriate to add the bonus. They only differ in scope, with Fate Core Skills being narrower in scope (you can only sometimes attempt to Shoot), and with FAE Approaches being basically global in scope (you can almost always attempt to be Forceful).<br><br>One is vocational while the other is descriptive, and thus subjectively they can &quot;feel&quot; different during actual play, but objectively both Skills and Approaches are just labeled bonuses that differ in permissiveness of applicability.

There is no mechanical bias to that fundamental idea. The player either is following along and has some kind of mental representation of the so-called &quot;theater of the mind&quot; in which the shared context of the game is being acted out upon which allows them to express their character&#39;s actions in a way that is compatible with it, or they are not. Mechanics don&#39;t facilitate this. You don&#39;t need mechanics to do this; you can just sit down with one or more friends and collaboratively narrate a story.<br><br>At best, mechanics can stay out of the way of this process of shared understanding, and at worst they can interfere with it.<br><br>Given two different mechanics, it is possible to state that one of them may interfere with &quot;engaging with the fiction&quot; less than the other. <br><br>But Skill vs Approach...they are fundamentally the same thing except that Skills are more restrictive than Approaches, and thus it is very difficult, I would think, to make the case that Approaches interfere with engaging with the fiction more than Skills do despite being less restrictive in their application.<br><br>Just as  &quot;I Forcefully Create Advantage&quot; means nothing unto itself, so to does &quot;I take the Create Advantage action using Shoot&quot; mean nothing unto itself.<br><br>Tying either statement to the narrative requires context, but in either case given a context, it is possible to ground either of the mechanical statements into the emerging story...with the FAE Approach having the edge there because it is less restricted in its applicability than the Shoot Skill is. There will be more contexts where it doesn&#39;t make sense to Create Advantage using Shoot, but wherein there is some kind of Advantage that can be created in a Forceful way.<br><br></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T15:25:00-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">But, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/101742400200431830430" oid="101742400200431830430" >Ed Hastings</a></span>, while I generally agree with you, Skills <b>look</b> like they might be able to be used for more list-based/mechanics-based gaming, and a number of people <b>do</b> try to approach Fate in that way - which leads, I think, to a lot of the &quot;Fate is too meta&quot; complaints.

If hacking / decking is a thing in that setting, then there is some idea of how that is supposed to work as part of that setting, and the players are aware of it.<br><br>Probably, just taking an Aspect such as &quot;El Hacker Supremo&quot; or &quot;IC Killer&quot; or &quot;Hat-less Hacker&quot; or &quot;Mad Cyber Skillz&quot;, is enough to justify attempting to hack stuff.  If you want to be really good at it, you could take one or more Stunts to cement the idea and gain reliability. <br><br>&quot;Hibachi Cyberdeck ZX-4000: because I have a sweet tricked out cyberdeck, I gain +2 to Overcome actions when I am jacked in and attempt to hack my way past obstacles&quot;<br><br>Of course, it would also be possible to treat the cyberdeck as a situational Aspect gained via Create Advantage, with some story set up. This would be better suited if hacking were not a main focus for your character as it imposes some amount of set up to get going.<br><br>And of course you could elevate the cyberdeck to being an Aspect unto itself if it were somehow part of your character&#39;s identity.  I would tend to express my &quot;hacker&quot; Aspect in a way that incorporated the gear, such as &quot;Well Equipped Hacker&quot; or &quot;Have Cyberdeck Will Hack&quot;, rather than spend two Aspect slots on such close Aspects. I prefer to not model gear as Aspects myself in general, but there are cases where it makes sense. And there is a mechanical reason to do so as well, as you could invoke both on a given action for a +4 bonus.<br><br><br>As far as the &quot;Don&#39;t trust Krusk&quot; thing...I&#39;m not entirely following your point there. There&#39;s some missing context. But I&#39;m assuming you mean you don&#39;t want to have to take an Aspect stating a relationship between your character and another character. <br><br>And if so, the answer is simple...you don&#39;t have to do that. You can do it if for some reason that relationship is important to your character&#39;s concept. Does their lack of trust of this person named Krusk come up a lot? Does it compel them to act in a certain way due to the mistrust? Does it allow them to affect the narrative in a way that is beneficial to themselves? If the answers are &quot;no&quot;...then don&#39;t take it as an Aspect or Trouble. <br><br>If your character has some kind of relationship with some other character, that&#39;s just roleplaying. Unless you want it to become a defining element of your character and impact their ongoing story in a significant way; then you would consider rolling that relationship into an Aspect.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T15:50:43-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" oid="102904726536647261493" >Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a></span>: &quot;You don&#39;t need mechanics to do this&quot;<br><br>No, the mechanics come into play when you say someone is doing something where the result isn&#39;t obvious.<br><br>So the flow is:<br>1) Say an action in terms of the imagined world<br>2) Rely on mechanics to resolve it<br><br>instead of...<br>1) Say an action in terms of mechanics<br>2) Rely on mechanics to resolve it<br><br>Nobody&#39;s talking about going full freeform.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+EdHastingsKillerShrike" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ed Hastings (Killer Shrike)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T15:52:12-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-03T15:59:10-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" oid="102904726536647261493" >Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a></span>...and that isn&#39;t what I said.

I think much of it concerns GMs handling of situations as well, though.  Character Aspects also represent something of a contract with the GM to keep those things in mind and create dramatic situations that meaningfully engage with different Aspects.  The case of a character with a Super Strong Aspect was offered earlier and, for me, a situation where that Aspect only mattered when it was invoked would constitute a failing on the part of the GM.  Basically, certain challenges ought to become more or less relevant based on the Aspects of the character in play.  The Super Strong character shouldn&#39;t be asked to roll for certain types of actions that other characters would have to.  Doing so would break trust with the players.<br><br>I think part of the art of GMing in Fate is to craft scenes and challenges that acknowledge and build upon who the characters are, and Aspects constitute a primary forum for players to cue the GM in on what they want/expect from the story.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T15:55:11-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-03T16:12:40-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/111021074892106600223" oid="111021074892106600223" >Bean Lucas</a></span> Except, in my experience, many people struggle to understand the basics of Fate Core or outright misinterpret it, regardless of how much person tries to teach them, until one day they didn&#39;t wake up and simply get Aspects/FP economy/etc.<br><br>Not because of the lack of effort on either part, really.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+EdHastingsKillerShrike" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ed Hastings (Killer Shrike)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T16:04:13-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-03T16:17:04-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/110944753793217338366" oid="110944753793217338366" >David Whitton</a></span>, agreed. There is a form of social contract at play here. <br><br>I think the general concern of the players who anchor on the idea of &quot;paying to invoke&quot; the Aspect to &quot;turn it on&quot; are unconcerned about narrative fluff when they are just described to do super strong things and are more concerned in the context of when there is a roll required and they feel like their &quot;super strength&quot; should be impactful without having to pay for it.<br><br>This sort of concern is particularly strong when bringing in new players before they&#39;ve had a taste for the game and the GM&#39;s permissiveness. Players coming from more of an adversarial approach to games in particular have reason to be concerned about things like this; in the sorts of games they are used to the DM / GM is their foe and the rules and particularly reliable bonuses are their only protection against a killer DM. For that kind of player, flat bonuses allow them to crunch the numbers up front and make decisions based upon likelihood of success in games where the stakes do include character death. <br><br>Fate turns all of that on its head, but before they can get into the game and realize that they have a strong say in the stakes and that character death is usually not on the table unless it is agreed upon..and even then they can concede to avoid it, and the GM is not an adversary, and the things that are mostly &quot;fluff&quot; in the kinds of games they are used to is kind of the whole point in this game with roll offs only happening when it matters and / or is interesting...before they can get into all of that, they first have to get thru character creation.<br><br>And for them, character creation is about spending finite resources to secure the maximum amount of effectiveness at whatever mechanical resolutions that their character is supposed to be good at. I&#39;m the strong guy on the team? I better make sure I can make any roll necessary to succeed at being the strong guy. That&#39;s what the other games they&#39;ve played have trained them to do. Thus the trepidation or discomfort of depending on bonuses that aren&#39;t always available. <br><br>Obviously, I&#39;m talking about a certain kind of player with a particular sort of background, and not making general statements. However, that certain kind of player and that particular sort of background happen to be pretty common in our hobby. So, its not an edge case, I don&#39;t think. <br><br></div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T16:09:35-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-03T16:13:28-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/101742400200431830430" oid="101742400200431830430" >Ed Hastings</a></span> You forget the part, where Aspect/Stunt slots are limited, while facts I think might become important can be 2-3 times longer.<br><br>I already used all Aspect/Stunt-slots and there is no more for cyberdeck.

If you don&#39;t want to play Fate Core or FAE, then don&#39;t. <br><br>If you do, then there are some agreed upon parameters for a given campaign.<br><br>If you are playing in a campaign wherein PC&#39;s have 3 Refresh, 3 Aspects, 1 High Concept, 1 Trouble, and 3 free Stunts, then you as a player need to find a way to fit your concept into that, just like all of the other players. This is true of all games wherein PC&#39;s are assumed to start as &quot;equals&quot;.<br><br>If you can&#39;t figure out a way to fit your concept into the available resources, you could seek the guidance of your group, or the community as a whole. If your concept just isn&#39;t workable in the design space provided, you can consult with your GM and the group and figure something out. If you can&#39;t find a way to cooperate to make a character that is acceptable to yourself or your play group, then I guess you wont be playing with that group. Again, this is not really any different than making a character for most other rpg&#39;s.<br><br>Don&#39;t have room to fit your fancy cyberdeck into your character concept? Well, I guess it isn&#39;t really that important to you then. It&#39;s really on you as the player to decide what things are important to your character. Can you still address the idea of it? Sure; there generally isn&#39;t anything preventing you from having a list of trappings on your character sheet  if you want them; they have no mechanical effect (unless required to use something that does have a mechanical effect, such as Guns and Shoot), but it might become relevant later. You aren&#39;t required to take an Aspect or Stunt indicating you wear clothes or carry a pack of bubble gum or a cell phone either. It&#39;s just descriptive stuff that might be relevant from time to time but offers no special bonus and does not benefit from any kind of protected status. Stuff is stuff.<br><br>I do think you seem to have some kind of misconception about what constitutes an Apsect, stemming from an idea that &quot;Everything can be important fact, and I have pretty good idea what should, but what if doesn&#39;t fit into Aspect slot space?&quot; (sic). <br><br>Your character&#39;s Aspects describe their identity, their place in the setting, their focus on the story, their shtick. Not every conceivable thing about them, but rather the most important things.<br><br>Your character might like Peanut Butter, and have a strong dislike of Japanese Game Shows, but that doesn&#39;t mean you need to express such trivialities as an Aspect. You can if you want to, but then you are saying that it is REALLY IMPORTANT that your character likes Peanut Butter, or whatever, and that you intend for it to be a recurring theme impacting the narrative.<br><br><br>You also have a variety of options available to formalize some things that do occur as a game progresses. One, you can have situational Aspects attached to a scene, or a group, or a person. Misc gear that has been picked up along the way can be represented via situational Aspects. That right there can address any number of kind-of-important-but-not-identity-impacting things. You can use Create Advantage to create such Aspects, and the GM can put them into play. <br><br>Another option is that over time, you can change your Aspects at milestones; this allows you to tweak or replace your Aspects to incorporate new things encountered along the way. <br><br>And, of course, Consequences are themselves Aspects; and some transitory things that are Aspect like but mostly disadvantaging can be pushed onto Consequences in certain situations. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T16:51:06-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-03T16:53:19-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Most details are not that important in some kinds of fiction.<br><br>There is different kinds of fiction.

A fact can be &quot;discovered&quot; by creating an Aspect stating it.

In a campaign set in the Dark Ages, &quot;The Earth Goes Around The Sun&quot; might be a great Aspect for an Astronomer at odds with the church or even as a campaign Aspect for a group of Natural Philosophers trying to bring about an Age of Reason.

In a fantasy setting with high magic, Water Is Wet might be a humorous / tongue-in-cheek Aspect for a Hydromancer to take and flog for surprising utility. <br><br>So, basically, just because something is a &quot;fact&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it needs to be represented as an Aspect. However, if it is interesting or serves a purpose, it can be. But if something is expressed as an Aspect, then it is also a fact.<br><br>Bob is a man, but not all men are Bob.<br>An Aspect is a fact, but not all facts are Aspects.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T17:01:06-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Specifically, aspects are a type of narrative causality.

Danks</a></span>  re: able swordsman: yes. And the answer can vary per campaign / hack. Fate doesn&#39;t have a default position on that per se. If the GM / group has decided to track gear and formalize it, then the answer of &quot;what weapon(s) do I carry?&quot; will flow from that decision. In a hack where gear doesn&#39;t matter per se, its just fluff, then the answer is more along the lines of &quot;what weapons do you WANT to have on you?&quot;.<br><br>In a hack that&#39;s in between, which is to say gear isn&#39;t formalized but can be made to be important for a given character via an Aspect or Stunt, then the player that cared would express the degree to which it is important to them by burning it into their character&#39;s concept via an Aspect, Stunt, or both.<br><br>From my Pathfinder FAE hack for instance, under the header &quot;Relevance of Specific Weapons and Armor&quot;, there&#39;s a block of text stating the intent for that hack. This is a snippet from that:<br><br><i>The character&#39;s competency is the primary factor; the tool they are using to exercise that competency is secondary and only matters to the extent that it makes the story more interesting.</i><br><br>...<br><br><i>To the extent that a particular kind of weapon or armor (etc) matters to a character or to the emerging story, it should be incorporated into Aspects and Stunts.</i><br><br>For instance, the fact that Bordos wears heavy armor and wields a hammer is reflected in his Aspects and Stunts. It is important to the character&#39;s concept and thus in the scenes that he is in he makes it matter to the narrative. On the other hand if Joe Fighterdude usually wears some heavy armor and uses a warhammer but didn&#39;t incorporate any of that into his concept in the form of Aspects or Stunts then ultimately it doesn&#39;t actually matter as anything more than fluff.<br><br></div><a href="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/PathfinderFateAccelerated.aspx" target="_blank" class="inline-link-embed"><img src="http://www.killershrike.com/Fate/Fae/Pathfinder/images/PathfinderFAEBanner2.jpg" alt=""><div class="link-title">Pathfinder (Fate Accelerated)</div></a></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T17:14:50-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Even in DFRPG, where weapons and armor <b>certainly</b> matter, they&#39;re not encoded as aspects or stunts.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+EdHastingsKillerShrike" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ed Hastings (Killer Shrike)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-03T17:16:26-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/102904726536647261493" oid="102904726536647261493" >Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi</a></span> on the contrary, I&#39;ve tried to understand what your position is and address your concerns as you have stated them in as detailed a way as I can so as to hopefully  avoid any confusion or misunderstanding. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanMDanks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ryan M.

On that note, a long time ago I did a thing called Demon Hunter: FBI, a very gritty street level supernatural sort of game, and published it in an APAzine. It was intended to be played with a pretty brutal, very dark tone.<br><br>Later, Dave Mattingly took the material and flipped it on its head for a tournament game; in which the players chose one of the pregens I had provided and a real life actor (such as Keanu Reeves, or Drew Barrymore as it turned out) to play that character on a TV show pilot. During the game, there were commercial breaks, and each break one of the players had to narrate a snippet of the &quot;show&quot; featuring their character doing something interesting that hadn&#39;t happened yet during the game as a outro for the commercial break, and then later the group had to figure out how to incorporate that snippet into the game as it elapsed.<br><br>In addition to being a really cool format for a rpg, it also resulted in a much lighter tone. And I learned a very valuable lesson about turning dials to get a drastically different usage out of the same material.<br><br>EDIT: dug it up out of the archives...<br><br>The actors chosen for the played PCs were:<br><br> Kris Kristofferson (Millennium, Blade) as David Finch, occultist<br><br> Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park, The Fly) as Allan Carter, investigator<br><br> Bill Fagerbakke (“Coach”, “Gargoyles”) as Billy Harker, redneck shooter<br><br> Drew Barrymore (Firestarter, Charlie’s Angels) as June Park, pyrokinetic<br><br> Wesley Snipes (Blade, Demolition Man) as Frank Mills, street fighter man<br><br> Keanu Reeves (The Matrix, Speed) as Sam Rudy, ex-Navy SEAL<br> Arnold Schwarzenegger (Commando, Eraser)  as Sam Rudy, ex-Navy SEAL<br><br>&quot;You’ll notice that there are two actors slated for the same<br>role.

It inherits from Fudge, sure, but there&#39;s significant enough differences that the two systems play pretty differently and often appeal to very different people.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+EdHastingsKillerShrike" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ed Hastings (Killer Shrike)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-04T22:40:16-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Yeah, and further, as a Lacrosse player I know that hockey is just Lacrosse on ice. ;)</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-04T22:41:31-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">You&#39;re dead to me.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+EdHastingsKillerShrike" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ed Hastings (Killer Shrike)</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-04T22:47:51-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-04T22:50:43-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I keed<br><br>But only a little; there is some shared history.<br><br>Early 19th-century paintings depict shinney (or &quot;shinny&quot;), an early form of hockey with no standard rules which was played in Nova Scotia.

As a person who focuses on the latter, I prefer to use tiers of classification, so GURPS, and Fate are actually amazingly similar in certain ways (ways that make them both more attractive to me than many other games). Further, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that the writers of Fudge, and Fate had worked on projects for GURPS, and Hero, which are related. <br><br>There is no reason to say that a given game isn&#39;t another game, names help with that, but to refute that hockey, and lacrosse are in the same family, just for the sake of classification, isn&#39;t any more useful than saying all games are games, and that&#39;s all we need say about it.<br><br>A game like Whitehack is both Fate-like, and D&amp;D like, so using a form of classification that only seeks to segregate isn&#39;t going to foster understanding. It may make things simpler to grok, but what we&#39;d be grokking isn&#39;t what is out there, in reality. Our understanding is based upon the limited amount of information we&#39;re allowing in our heads. <br><br>A caterpillar, and butterfly are much more different than each other than Fate is from Fudge, or Hockey is from Lacrosse, yet we don&#39;t feel the need to segregate them, because their relationship makes it obvious that they are related significantly. <br><br>At some point in our past, surely someone did think they were entirely different creatures, but once the process of transformation was witnessed, it became impossible to place the superficial classification before the reality. <br><br>I didn&#39;t say every game is Fate, but it&#39;s definitely the case that Fate can be made to suit any game. I know, because I&#39;ve done it. <br><br>Given Fate is on it&#39;s 4th iteration, it&#39;s quite hard for me to agree that it can&#39;t be many things to many people, even before we get to the fact that people have been house ruling it for years, many volumes offering ways to tweak Fate to taste have been published by third parties, and Evil Hat itself. <br><br>So, I suppose the question I would pose is if a gaming group starts with Fate, and starts implementing tweaks to aid in practical application of that rule set (in it&#39;s current state) at what point are they obligated to say they are no longer playing Fate?<br><br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a reasonable answer to that, anymore than there is a reason answer to the age old question of who has the right to name the object of their devotion as a true god. <br><br>The mech of games can be discussed without referring to the brands of the games that use them, and using the brands doesn&#39;t really provide a ton of clarification, unless someone really gets into specifics. <br><br>I my estimation, using brands, names, and such labels has been much improved upon by the practice of tagging. Music has benefited greatly in this regard. If I am creating music, it doesn&#39;t matter how many people are arguing about what my work should be called. It&#39;s better, for my sake, to allow all those labels to be used as tags, and lead to the venue that makes my work accessible.<br><br>Things that are Fate-like are:<br>-Not having levels<br>-Not having class restrictions<br>-Not having racial classification<br>-Focus upon Skills<br>-Use of Advantages/Feats/Stunts<br>-No Hit Points<br>-Not having compulsory character Death<br>-Tracking Injury/Conditions with descriptors<br>-Focus upon particulars of an individual character, rather than upon a generic set of peoples upon which generalizations will be made that limit the individual <br><br>There are, of course many more, &quot;Fate-like&quot; things, but when listed, it becomes obvious that if those things are &quot;Fate-like&quot;, and other games also possess them, if the word &quot;like&quot; is to retain any significance, those other games must be &quot;like&quot; Fate, to one degree, or another. <br><br>So, I can agree that some games are more, or less like Fate, but very few games are completely unlike Fate, and even those games that are least like it (Amber Diceless comes to mind) may have some relation that is not plainly obvious. <br><br>I suppose I don&#39;t see the point in drawing a line. I do see the point though, in explaining that if certain things are done, certain outcomes may be unavoidable. <br><br>So, in this case, if someone insists on playing Fate with Aspects that only come into play if paid for, telling them that they aren&#39;t really playing Fate, if they do that, helps little. Telling them that the effects of playing Fate that way are X, Y, and Z takes a lot more time, and consideration, but it&#39;s the right thing to do, because it&#39;s more likely to reach the intended goal. <br><br>Advising players of Fate about the alternatives, specifically to playing with Aspects that have persistent effects, is going to be even more effective than drawing lines, because players can then make informed decisions about what kind of Fate they want to be playing. <br><br>Fate is now a lot different than it was, and that&#39;s due to that fact the publishers played it differently than they originally intended, and solicited input from people who hacked it, sometimes to such a degree it no longer closely resembled itself. <br><br>I think it&#39;s important to recognize that Fate is a brand, at this point, and that the actual mechanics behind that brand are very likely to continue changing, and that the people who may be seen as having gross misunderstanding about what others think of as the fundaments of Fate may actually be drivers of those changes. <br><br>It really depends upon who widely adopted certain variations are, and if they effectively address problems that are common throughout the population that plays Fate. <br><br>A person could argue that 5e D&amp;D is no longer D&amp;D, for any number of reasons. They&#39;d be incorrect, from a practical stand point, but if the same information they used to found their case was instead focused upon a discussion of how different 5e is from 1e, it would be difficult to refute, because it wouldn&#39;t be an argument. It would be a statement of fact.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-05T10:35:33-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Another way to put it, if we&#39;re playing Monopoly, and among our group we decide when you go to Jail, you can collect $200, we are still playing Monopoly, though we have significantly altered one of the most well known rules of that game. <br><br>Someone could say that we were no longer playing Monopoly, but that would be grossly inaccurate, given we have only altered one rule, even though the cascading effect of that alteration might have deep ramifications. <br><br>It could be useful to create a second tier descriptor, such as Bank Robber Monopoly, to make that variation categorically different, yet allow the reality that we are still, very much, playing Monopoly, to survive the process of classification.<br><br>Aspect Only Fate, is an example of using that modality to preserve the lineage of a playstyle, but meaningfully distinguish one style from another for the sake of convenience. <br><br>BTW, I highly recommend Aspect only play as a first step to any group learning Fate. In fact, after playing Edge of the Empire, it seems like EH should write up a tutorial that breaks down play into bite sized chunks. EotE&#39;s beginner set is brilliant in that way.

In this case Alt, Thrash, and Doom, respectively.<br><br>Generally those who are fans will be more permissive, while detractors will be the ones making Herculean effort to enforce less permeable labeling strategies. <br><br>&quot;Nickelback is not Metal!&quot; is not a phrase a Nickleback fan is likely to spend much time voicing.)<br><br><br>It seems to me that there&#39;s no fear of mistaking a caterpillar for a butterfly, or any larva for it&#39;s winged form, if we permit ourselves to allow the species name to be applied to both, even subjects that deviate from what is familiar to us. <br><br>&quot;That is a Monarch butterfly, while that is still a Monarch, though a caterpillar.&quot;<br><br>The practice a optimal tagging isn&#39;t much different than that used in the best dictionaries. Publishing multiple definitions for the same word may take more research, ink, and effort, but it&#39;s a superior approach if the intent of a book is to teach people the entire scope of a given word.<br><br>Some dictionaries opt for brevity, and at that point, the editor is directing the understanding of language, and not actually representing the language as it is actually spoken, or the truth that language is fluid.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-05T11:19:31-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Yeah, I&#39;m with you on tagging.

Instead, we acknowledge they are the same species, and focus upon a new label, Breed, for the sake of convenience (though it&#39;s more of a description of an ideal we are forcing upon dogs than any essential truth about the dogs, since it&#39;s obvious, they could breed with any number of dogs that have other traits, if they are permitted to do so). <br><br>In this way, every label tells me a bit more about who is using it than it does about the thing being referred to, though if I log away the connections certain people make with a given word, what they label with it, that can be useful. It can also be problematic though. I&#39;d say it&#39;s double sided, and whether a person wants to call it a coin, or a blade, it&#39;s not all good, or bad. <br><br>The most significant thing about the label Fate is that it distinguishes this particular variant more clearly, and effectively on the market, and I think that Rob, and Fred definitely deserve recognition for their contribution, as do all the wonderful authors (Richard&#39;s Secret Life of Cats is sitting right next to Brad Murray&#39;s Diaspora, and Starblazer&#39;s Adventure&#39;s, LoA, and a print copy of Free Fate) who have helped Fate stand out from the other variants of Fudge so far as to be more well known than that the large body of ideas that may as well serve as a species umbrella. So, Fate is under Fudge, while Secret Life of Cats is under Fate. The fact that SLoC uses the same Ladder, and dice as Fudge is hugely significant to categorizing it properly, I think. If a discussion is just about games that fall under the Fate tag, then it&#39;s not relevant to discuss all variations of Fudge, but if we&#39;re seeking solutions not presented by any Fate-like game, stepping up into Fudge-like games makes a lot of sense, because the underpinnings of all of those games will be nearly identical to Fate-like games. I mean to say that they will be designed to deal with 4dF, and the Ladder.<br><br>Anyone who is interested in how to adapt several of the mech in Fate in ways not suggested by Fate Core, or the Toolkit should definitely acquire other variants of Fudge though. Much of the new ground people have sought was covered decades ago, and it was all very open, before OGL ever came into being.<br><br>On my shelf, Fate, and Fudge books are right next to each other, because they are so compatible. <br><br><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/101742400200431830430" oid="101742400200431830430" >Ed Hastings</a></span>, I feel that, philosophically, Fate, Hero, GURPS, Fudge , HARP (formerly MERP), Rolemaster, Traveller, and a host of other games are almost identical. <br><br>I refer to the difference not by categorizing the ggames, but their mechnics, because games may contain mech that blur any line applied to the entire system. <br><br>I tend to refer to this distinction as Qualifying vs. Quantifying. <br><br>It&#39;s pretty easy to recognize the difference. If you can look at a character sheet, and tell me what kind of character it is without knowing anything about the system, it&#39;s a system, that at least in part, if focused on Qualifying. If instead, the character sheet is mostly seen as arcane code by the eyes of a noob, that&#39;s a system focused upon Quantifying. <br><br>Games that Qualify are worried about how an individual stands apart, while games that Quantify are concerned with what predetermined slot a character falls into. <br><br>Qualifying requires rules that permit new ideas to be made flesh, and only the ideas that are relevant will be listed on the character sheet, so as to make room for all of the things that matter. Quantifying requires rules that assume there is nothing new under the sun, everything can be boiled down to essentials and everything falls into one category,  or another, and all categories that are relevant will be listed upon the character sheet, whether the values are significant, or not. <br><br>I like to use Conan as an example, because most people know about him. If you looked at a character sheet of Conan as created in any of the Qualifying systems I have listed, you would recognize who it was, even if the name wasn&#39;t among the traits listed, and you could play him accordingly. <br><br>If you looked at a character sheet of Conan created in any of the Quantifying systems, you wouldn&#39;t know who you were looking at, unless there was a name, because he&#39;s look like pretty much every other Fighter/Thief.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/111021074892106600223" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Bean Lucas</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-07T12:44:52-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2016-10-07T12:46:16-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">EvilHat seems to think that it&#39;s true, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/117281067526668029159" oid="117281067526668029159" >T to the E to the O</a></span> .

IF not, you should. If so, have another go.<br><br>They suggest that you can adjust the ladder, and EH&#39;s is remarkably similar, employing tweaks suggested either in the core system documents, or later articles in the magazine The Fudge Factor (which was the first location for the publication of the idea of Aspects, to be used in Fudge. In fact, the F is Fate was originally for Fudge). They offer variants upon what FP can do, and admittedly, EH&#39;s variant is radical, but the core book of Fudge is really a heaping slew of articles authored by many different people. They cover many iterations of what you can do, if you want a certain tone, and direction to you game. You can have stats, or not, skills, or not, this, or not, that, or not. <br><br>The rules of Fate could easily just be among them in an updated volume. <br><br>Fred, and Rob took the liberty provided by the spirit of Fudge to cut their own path, and that&#39;s good, because Grey Ghost wasn&#39;t being as effective at promoting one of my favorite systems. <br><br>No longer citing Fudge&#39;s license was a calculated move. Fudge itself is currently using the OGL&#39;s language, so it is no surprise that Fate followed suit. <br><br>Really though, the mechanics of a game, any game, are not protected IP. Only the language, and trademarks are. <br><br>dF could have been protected, given they are a actual patentable object/idea. Fortunately for EH, O&#39;Sullivan didn&#39;t go that route.<br><br>This is all really a matter of gaming history, and it seems like the quibble among some is whether EH has a right to distinguish themselves. I think they do, but I also think history, and more importantly, knowing, and acknowledging it, is a virtuous thing. Sometimes the attempt to erase Fudge feels a bit Orwellian.<br><br>It seems that one thing the OSR community has a bit more of is reverence for their forebears, and I think it&#39;s because most are obsessively aware of who started D&amp;D. No matter how radically different a system gets, so long as it uses the underpinnings of D&amp;D, it&#39;s pretty much mandatory that it be acknowledged as a form of that game. <br><br>True20, Hackmaster, D20 Star Wars, Whitehack, The Black Hack, DCC, even the editions of official D&amp;D themselves all arguably vary from each other more widely than Fate Core does from Fudge, in play. <br><br>I don&#39;t think that in any forum dedicated to any of those games it would be the least bit controversial to suggest that they are forms of D&amp;D. It would be more of an, &quot;Of course they are, now let&#39;s move onto things that matter.&quot; proposition.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TeoMorgan" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Teo Morgan</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-10-09T02:46:34-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I suppose an analogy that&#39;s apt would be UNIX. At what point is it okay for developers to say their system is no longer UNIX? Linux (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian, Slackware, etc.), BSD, OSX, Orbis, iOS, Chrome, Android, and others are all Unix based systems, and differ in major ways from what UNIX once was. They all still work, at their core, on premises established by Bell Labs though, so are considered UNIX-like, even though they have come so far from what UNIX was when Bell Labs initially created. <br><br>Surely, in regards to their ancestor, all of these OS are far more different, and contain far more new code than could be said of Fate compared to Fudge.<br><br>All of the developers, and Corporations that own the rights to the OS listed also have the right to distinguish their work from that of others, but they don&#39;t need to deny the contributions of earlier pioneers in order to do that.</div></div></div></body></html>
