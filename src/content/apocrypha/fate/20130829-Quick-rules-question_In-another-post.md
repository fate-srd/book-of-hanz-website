You cannot shoot someone into blabbing information. However, I think we&#39;re getting distracted by the particular details and have lost the real thrust of the question<br><br>The real question (at least for me) is:<br><br>1) How much narrative authority does the winner have when someone is taken out. What are the limits of that authority.<br><br>2) Can you offer things in a concession that couldn&#39;t already be part of being taken out? Or are the results of what could be offered during a concession by definition a subset of what could be narrated as part of taking someone out?<br><br>I think that&#39;s fairly worded, and gets to the crux of our previous discussion. Now I&#39;m going to jump in with my opinion.<br><br>First, I don&#39;t like setting the stakes for a conflict at the beginning of the conflict. In my opinion, that may be a nice place to start, but the conflict will naturally evolve and change.<br><br>Instead, I like to focus on the current narrative. Therefore the narrative control gained by taking someone out is not limited by the initial stakes, but limited by the current situation at the time the person is taken out.<br><br>So, in the gun battle, if one of the PCs described how he was sneaking up behind the NPC, then he made an attack that took the NPC out, I would say that narrating something like, &quot;I place my gun against the back of his head, and tell him to start talking or I&#39;ll blow his brains out.&quot;<br><br>This seems like it should be pretty uncontroversial so far. The NPC is out of the fight, and is at the PCs mercy. He can basically kill him without another roll. He can also freely interrogate him.<br><br>Now, can the PC force the NPC to talk as part of being taken out? Maybe, maybe not. For me, it depends a lot on the nature of the information at stake, the personality of the NPC and just my gut instincts. I might let him start blabbing. I might require that we switch to a mental conflict, as the PCs start interrogating him. In either case, the physical conflict is over. It cannot start up again (at least, not until something happens to drastically change the scene).<br><br>But the answer to that question really isn&#39;t important. The important question is, if the PCs cannot narrate that the NPC started talking, could the GM offer to have the NPC start talking as part of a concession (before the roll that took him out, of course)?<br><br>I say no.<br><br>Here&#39;s my thinking.<br><br>1) Remember, we&#39;re not talking about the NPC negotiating with the PCs. The concessions are a meta-game tool. It&#39;s the players and the GMs that are negotiating. I think allowing concessions like this muddles what&#39;s going on. It starts to feel like the characters are stopping in the middle of the fight and saying, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ll give up and tell you everything if you stop shooting.&quot; That&#39;s not what we&#39;re really talking about here.<br><br>If the NPCs want to surrender, or want to offer up information, that&#39;s fine. They can do that as their action--and the PCs can respond to it however they wish. That&#39;s character-to-character negotiation. But, it shouldn&#39;t be part of a concession.<br><br>2) Concessions also have to make sense given the current narrative. If it doesn&#39;t make sense as the outcome of the stated action for being taken out, it still doesn&#39;t make sense as a concession.

If they want to surrender and spill the beans, fine. Let them offer as their action. The players can respond however they wish. No need to use the concession rules at all.<br><br>Concessions, to my mind, are a very specific mechanic. They are used to control how a character is taken out. They are used to limit the amount of narrative control the attacker gets over his victory. Not all fights need to end in with someone conceding or being taken out.<br><br>The good thing is, the discussion has clarified how I think about these things--whether they are &quot;official&quot; or not. The more I think of it, the more I believe that I should only use concessions as a direct response to an attack action. And, the outcome needs to make sense given the action.<br><br>Say Grokk the Barbarian launches himself at Timmy the Mage. Grokk&#39;s player describes his action, &quot;I come at you in a flying leap, swinging my ax in a massive, two-handed overhead blow.&quot; He then reaches for his dice.<br><br>Player 2 looks at his sheet and says, &quot;Um, I think I&#39;ll concede. Let&#39;s say I surrender and tell you everything I know about Minister Doug&#39;s secret plans?&quot;<br><br>This doesn&#39;t work for me. Why? It&#39;s not consistent with the action. Timmy simply does not have time to make an offer. Grokk is in the middle of a blow. The narrated outcome needs to at least acknowledge that somehow.<br><br>If Grokk&#39;s actions were narrated more vaguely. e.g. &quot;I shoulder my ax and attack.&quot; Then I&#39;d be more willing to allow it. But, if I did allow it, I&#39;d probably also allow it as the effect of being taken out. If it&#39;s consistent enough with the current action in one case, it&#39;s consistent in both. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Fred Hicks</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-08-31T18:00:19-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">That example gets into the whole question of whether getting to the point of &quot;being in the middle of a blow&quot; is appropriate before the option for concession is engaged. <br><br>In a socially negotiated storytelling situation timing has to be less rigid than that, IMO. &quot;Before he starts to swing,&quot; interjects the target, &quot;I&#39;d like to concede.&quot; The clock rolls back just a little.

Assume I shoot at someone. Let&#39;s also assume that we all agree, if I roll well and take them out, I cannot narrate that they surrender and tell me all their secrets.<br><br>Now, instead of letting me take the roll, they decide to offer a concession. Can they offer to surrender and tell me all of their secrets? <br><br>I have real problems with this. I feel that concessions also need to flow naturally from the narrative--just like the taken out resolutions. If it&#39;s not a natural outcome of my action, I can&#39;t use it when I take some one out. Therefore, they also cannot use it as a concession.<br><br>And, I have real trouble wrapping my brain around how this example would work narratively. It just doesn&#39;t feel right to me.<br><br>If they want to surrender. Sure. Let them use their action to do it. They can dive behind cover and shout out, &quot;Stop shooting...stop shooting. We&#39;ll tell you everything you want to know.&quot; That&#39;s fine.<br><br>But doing it as, essentially, a reaction to someone else&#39;s action--I just can&#39;t make it flow in my mind the way a movie would. It knocks me out of the story, and makes me aware of the mechanics in a way I&#39;m just not comfortable with.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s just me. But, I really want to maintain the illusion of the story.
