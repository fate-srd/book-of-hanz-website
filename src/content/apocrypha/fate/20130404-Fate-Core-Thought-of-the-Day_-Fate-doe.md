here.  &quot;Damage&quot; is primarily a &quot;physics&quot; concept - what the actual physical effect something like an attack or a fall has on your body.  Fate doesn&#39;t model that, and doesn&#39;t want to.  It models fiction.<br><br>Now, what&#39;s interesting about fights or other conflicts in fiction is not the detailed description of exactly what the physical effects of a sword blow are.  It&#39;s the <b>impact</b> that they have on the story on an ongoing basis.  Whether it&#39;s Harry Dresden having a headache, or John McClane limping from his feet being hurt from glass, what fiction cares about is the impact that the fight has on the story.  If an &quot;injury&quot; is purely internal, or in another way doesn&#39;t impact the story, <b>it&#39;s irrelevant</b>.<br><br>And that&#39;s what Consequences model.  They model the continuing impact of the conflict and how it carries through the story.<br><br>And this is awesome.  Because it opens up all sorts of options.  There&#39;s only so many ways you can describe damage, but there&#39;s <b>lots</b> of possible consequences from a fight.  Big sword hit?  Sure, it can be a <b><i>Gashed Leg</i></b>. But.. that&#39;s not very interesting.  But if you assume that there&#39;s no damage model, then you can also dodge aside at the last moment and hit your head, giving you a <b><i>Ringing Headache</i></b>.  You can barely parry it aside at the last moment, making you <b><i>Fearful of Your Own Mortality</i></b>.  It can destroy a mystic artifact you&#39;re holding, leaving you <b><i>Half In This World</i></b>.<br><br>The Stress and Consequences model dictates the level of lasting impact an Attack has on a character.  It&#39;s not a &quot;damage&quot; model, so it doesn&#39;t dictate the <b>type</b>.  That&#39;s up to you, your table, and your game.  Make it awesome.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/110328815147903244967">Tyler Duckworth (PhDTwenty)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109423627776558241037">Fisk Gaming</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116933619070129508637">Ian Matthews</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JTDimino">J.T.

A target can&#39;t assign a consequence to an injury, like a broken arm? No, you can do that... but it&#39;s not damage... At least mechanically... Well there are mechanics that explain how to do it, but they&#39;re not &quot;damage&quot; mechanics. <br><br>It&#39;s a narrative tool and a damage mechanic, the two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.

Throughout, you&#39;ll use Fate Core&#39;s mechanics to model how fiction, not physics, operates, producing an experience that&#39;s better than &quot;realistic&quot; -- it&#39;s authentic. &quot;<br><br>Now, of course, people don&#39;t have to play that way, but since these posts are about my trying to gain better insight into the author&#39;s goals, deliberately contradicting these goals isn&#39;t something that is particularly productive.  And that&#39;s the core disagreement, put a slightly different way.<br><br>So really, I&#39;m proposing that we each acknowledge these differences, and deliberately avoid dragging each other&#39;s positive contributions to this community into the type of circular argument that this thread has been doing for the past ten or so responses.  I&#39;m still happy to hear your thoughts on the game, as I find you have a lot of insight.  I&#39;m still happy to have you contribute to discussions I start, especially when they don&#39;t revolve around the &#39;narrative game vs. hybrid game&#39; core disagreement.  At the same time, I&#39;m more than happy to contribute to your posts that don&#39;t key on the &#39;narrative vs. hybrid game&#39; disagreement, simply because I find it unproductive, and frankly I think that doing so would be a little disrespectful to you.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+WilHutton" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Wil Hutton</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-04-04T22:14:10-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Using the fall example - let&#39;s say your friend does that and there is 6 stress.

The Moderate Consequence is your severe hurt and distrust of someone who you thought cared for you. Because to actually be pushed off the cliff, you&#39;d need to concede or get taken out.

The shove itself (which is the action taken by the npc) isn&#39;t going to physically harm the PC. The implication is that the fall will.

The PC has his chance to respond (before anything else new is introduced as a result of the fall, since I&#39;m a nice GM).  So he can make an overcome action at this point to try and end his &quot;Shoved off a Cliff&quot;. Perhaps Athletics to grab onto the cliff face and thus end his fall. This is of course opposed by the aspect with say average or fair opposition, plus any free invocations or fate points spent to up the opposition.<br><br>Now, even if our PC fails to overcome, he has the option to succeed at a cost, which he&#39;s smartly taken having seen me grinning like a stupid idiot at the thought of using the fate fractal to have the ground/gravity attack him. He takes a consequence for his success. Perhaps he has &quot;Pulled his Arm&quot; or has &quot;Salt in the Wound&quot; as his friend on the cliff overhead taunts him for being so foolish as to ever think they were friends. How fiendish.<br><br>The encounter then continues with our PC in the zone &quot;Cliff&quot; and the NPC in the next zone &quot;Cliff Top&quot; or something similar. The PC would likely have to make an overcome to climb up or down the cliff face, potentially complicated by new injuries.<br><br>Had the PC decided to not succeed at a cost... well he&#39;d have a good story about how he survived that legendary fall (probably via concession).<br><br>Anyway, that is how I would handle it. My method doesn&#39;t require a taken out result (which is a lot to ask for a simple shove), doesn&#39;t automatically inflict any kind of damage, etc. Further, having the PC trapped on a cliff face is a great time for our NPC to use provoke to really scar the PC after the betrayal.<br><br>And that&#39;s how I turned an example into a wall of text.

When I play it, think of them primarily as &quot;stress,&quot; thanks to Spirit of the Century and Fate. I encourage my fellow players to do the same. The way I see it, a character can be at less than full HP and not have a scratch, and be at full HP and look like hell. <br><br>I haven&#39;t played much Fate, but I did feel like I understood consequences as not having to be about damage. Yes, wonkiness is possible, though if the table collaborates on what a given consequence is, that should be a fairly minor issue at one&#39;s own table. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2016-06-07T19:16:13-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Consequences are the lasting, well, consequences of a Conflict outside of the story stakes.
