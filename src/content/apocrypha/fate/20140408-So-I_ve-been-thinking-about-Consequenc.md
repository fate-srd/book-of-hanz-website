Kind of?<br><br>Let&#39;s take my favorite example, the thief and the lock, and look at it from the locks point of view. If you only have an overcome action from the thief, the lock only sees the thief as a &quot;one aspect, one skill&quot; opposition. If you enter a challenge against the lock, the lock sees more of the thief, a few aspects, a few skills, maybe a stunt. Lastly, in a conflict, the lock sees the thief as the full character, aspects, skills, stunts, consequences.<br><br>So not having consequences in situations other than conflicts makes sense to me. The scene isn&#39;t too important, so I won&#39;t treat it as a full blown conflict, and this lesser importance of the scene sort of acts as plot armor for the character.<br><br><br>That being said, using them outside of conflicts will probably work just as well, though it will also make the heroes seem more vulnerable.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulVencill" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Paul Vencill</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-04-08T17:51:06-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I used that to model paradox backlash for my Mage hack and it worked pretty well, we thought. </div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/115588014513224643265" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aaron Schwarz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-04-08T18:27:34-0400</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2014-04-08T18:27:55-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">The &quot;take a Consequence and get a bonus to a roll&quot; thing from the OP is already in the Toolkit on page 60.<br><br>Extreme Effort. ﻿</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/114770718415603148735" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Michael Cole</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-04-08T18:31:31-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Kinda seems like to can use consequences anywhere In the system as they are aspects.
