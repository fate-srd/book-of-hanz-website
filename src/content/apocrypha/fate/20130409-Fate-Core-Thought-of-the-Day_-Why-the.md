myself.<br><br>My mindset is pretty fully old-school.  Yay, character death, and difficulty, and earning the awesome.  If you had asked me a year ago if it would make sense for a character to find a secret door that wasn&#39;t on the map, just because they&#39;d rolled well, I&#39;d ask if you were crazy.  If you told me a year ago that I&#39;d advocate not killing characters without a discussion, I&#39;d ask you to share your stash.  (BTW, I&#39;d still maintain those statements, <i>for certain types of games!</i>)<br><br>I started Fate with SotC and DFRPG.  And... it was a learning curve.  There were things I just wasn&#39;t getting, and I knew it.  But I liked enough of what was going on, and liked enough of Fate (my previous foray into more narrative systems had been Burning Wheel) that I stuck with it.  And the biggest issue, over and over again, was the fact that I was unconsciously trying to make Fate act like a more traditional system.<br><br>Where were the attributes?  Where were the things you put together?  How the heck did it make sense to have an aspect <b><i>Really Strong</i></b>, yet it only came into play on occasion?  This is madness!<br><br>But I stuck with it.  I read the books, I played with folks that got it (Hi, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/110682395387731432977" oid="110682395387731432977" >Jacob Poss</a></span>!).  I read responses from the gurus on this community (more than I care to name... most of you know who you are!).<br><br>At first, it was a few bits here and there that came together that were just awesome.  And then, at some point, something clicked.  It came together.  I <b>got</b> it.  &quot;Fiction, not physics&quot; became more than a cute catchphrase meaning that fun was more important than realism.  I stopped looking for more systems.  The airplanes-as-stunts in Kriegszeppelin Valkyrie made sense.  The importance of the Phase Trio clicked, and it wasn&#39;t just party cohesion.<br><br>When it all came together, I found a new way to play RPGs.  A way that&#39;s pretty awesome, and not very much like the D&amp;D I played when I was 10.<br><br>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong - I still like other ways of playing.  I&#39;ve got no problem with a goold old fashioned dungeon crawl, or a set of tactical set piece encounters with some story/investigation bits between them.  I&#39;ve had a heck of a lot of fun over the years playing those games, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more in the years to come.  I want to run an X-COM game at some point, and it almost certainly won&#39;t be in Fate (GURPS and Savage Worlds are the frontrunners atm).<br><br>And that&#39;s what these posts are about - detailing my realizations, and throwing them out there to maybe help other people that are struggling to come to grips with the same things I came to grips with.  So if I post something like, &quot;Fate doesn&#39;t have a damage system,&quot; don&#39;t take that as the prophet on the mount making a proclamation.  I&#39;m not into the holy prophet thing, given that the fashion choices are terrible and the life expectancy is generally worse.  Instead, take it as me going, &quot;Holy shit!  I just realized, this game doesn&#39;t have a damage system!  It thinks about the results of combat in an almost totally different way!  That&#39;s crazy cool!&quot;<br><br>So that&#39;s what these posts are about.  Trying to help others look at Fate with a bit of &quot;beginner&#39;s mind,&quot; and seeing it through eyes not trained by years of gaming in other systems.  It&#39;s about helping others to find the things that I find awesome in the system.  It&#39;s not about telling people they&#39;re doing things &quot;wrong&quot; - there&#39;s no Fate Police ready to knock down doors, the last I checked.  If you&#39;re having fun, as far as you&#39;re concerned, you&#39;re doing it right.  It&#39;s about sharing the things that I&#39;ve discovered about the system when I stopped trying to shove its square peg into a round hole.<br><br>And I&#39;ll say, doing that is <b>tough</b>.  We&#39;ve got a lot of things in traditional gaming that work, and make for awesome games.  In a lot of cases, deviating from those slightly doesn&#39;t work, as those games tend to sit on &quot;local maxima&quot; - areas where the decisions made work together in a tight, interlocked way.  But I think Fate sits on a very different local maximum than most games, and to find it you&#39;ve gotta change a lot of assumptions, and be willing to approach it like it was the very first game you&#39;ve played.  I&#39;ve found it to be worth it, and so I want to share what I&#39;ve learned to help others find that same awesome. <br><br>And if you&#39;re interested, come on along for the journey.  Share your insights with me, and I&#39;ll happily share mine with you.  If not, hell, maybe we&#39;ll get together and play a game that sits in a different area, and have fun doing that.</span></div></div><span itemprop="audience"><div class="visibility">Shared to the community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117231873544673522940">Fate Core</a> - Public</div></span><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+EmmanuelPapst">Emmanuel Papst (EmP)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChristophThill">Christoph Thill</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JuanmaBarranquero">Juanma Barranquero</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TimNoyce">Tim Noyce</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DaveCockburn">Dave Cockburn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+OliverGraf">Oliver Graf</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/118416878530582647978">Chris “Callisto” B</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/113059510043663667610">Christopher Allen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamSchwaninger">Adam Schwaninger</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105912177797448389192">Christopher Dyszelski</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/104892928505684381674">Mike Thompson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101223885539785381547">Rob Alexander</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AlexCorbett193">Grass Dragon (Grassdragon)</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+jeruvin">jason reynolds</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JoshuaRamsey">Joshua Ramsey</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KeithClendenen">Keith Clendenen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PhilVecchione">Phil Vecchione</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MarkDiazTruman">Mark Diaz Truman</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117173750916615651123">Rich Knight</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TomTysonbluetyson">Blue Tyson</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks">Fred Hicks</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/114333891799473775766">David Adams</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ColinMcMillen">Colin McMillen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108287480576898126045">Jon Tate</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115484991119248632805">Brett Bowen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JBBell">JB Bell</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DanHall">Dan Hall</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102350651551583625813">Lee Van Sickle</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RobMeyers">Rob Meyers</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/117342204790475767529">Jim Sandoval</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+IgorHollandMoritz">Igor Holland-Moritz</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DavidVriezen">David Vriezen</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RyanMDanks">Ryan M.

Yet, everytime I hear it, it kind of snaps my head back on one thing or another I was &quot;stuck&quot; on. I come back to the realization that FATE is different than other games.

That thief should have something like &quot;spend a fate point and you can remove an unaware enemy from the battlefield (free hiding it in a nearby place)&quot;.

Fate point usage acts as an interesting bidding mechanic, so combat becomes more about &quot;who wants it more&quot; and less about &quot;who can strategize better&quot;.  Where Fate really shines, to me, is in pushing the story along and in interesting, unexpected ways.  Even compels in combat can make the story go in a different way than expected :)<br><br>But I totally get where you&#39;re coming from.  My first game of Spirit of the Century went a lot like that, exacerbated by the higher default stress tracks, and while it was entertaining, I can definitely see where there were some bits lacking, especially with the repetitive aspect use.<br><br>Have your players also used Create Advantage to any great extent?  Have you played with the narrative reality of those advantages, or just viewed them as floating bonuses?  That was another thing that I kind of failed at my first few runs through the system.<br><br>Please don&#39;t take this comment as anything except for asking questions and offering suggestions, btw.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Fred Hicks</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-04-09T20:02:20-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">One of us!</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/110110374841646652137" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Tom Miskey</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-04-09T20:49:15-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">We have a lot in common Robert, I too started with the Moldvay Basic D&amp;D about 32 years ago, and have a long history actually playing more traditional games, but always interested in more narrative systems.  2 of the most influential for me were Castle Falkenstein (the game that introduced me to &quot;steampunk fantasy&quot; and the narrative creation of characters formed by asking questions), and Adventure!, with its system of Dramatic Editing (my introduction to the idea of players being able to momentarily take over for the GM and describe a part of the setting or world to their advantage, such as &quot;There IS a secret door here after all!&quot;, to use your example).<br><br>One of the things I love about Fate is that it is NOT just a fully narrative system, but a marriage of traditional game elements (skills and stunts) to the narrative aspects.  That allows each group to emphasize what they are most comfortable with.  If you want, you can play mostly as a traditional system and use aspects sparingly, as you would Karma in MSH or Hero Points in DC Adventures, with few compels to resupply them and simply a boost when it&#39;s vital.  Or you could go the other way and play up the aspects and narrative so much that the swarm of Fate points flying around the table makes the skill and stunt rankings almost meaningless.  That flexibility allows it to appeal to a wider audience than it otherwise might if it were all one or the other.  It also makes it a great base to hack from and subtly shift and mold in your desired direction and flavor without a great deal of effort.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+FredHicks" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Fred Hicks</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2013-04-09T20:52:13-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Yeah, Fate is very much an outgrowth of an omnivorous attitude towards the RPG hobby.
