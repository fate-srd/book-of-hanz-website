If you trap him, you&#39;re doing the work. If he sees a trap, has the option to skip it, but goes for it anyway, reward his recklessness. He decides to tick off the bouncer with his smart mouth.? Point. He sees the bullies close around. The innocent schoolboy? Point. Or, it&#39;s backstory. You trap him ninjas, and the lead ninja is an enemy from his past.

So I&#39;d go for tying GM intrusions to a really small handful of Aspects, whether plot-wise (maybe the current issue and impending issue), or theme-wise (one global Theme Aspect?), or character arc-wise (the group I&#39;m in has tried using a &quot;Kicker&quot; Aspect for each PC to describe the desperate motivation that&#39;s &quot;compelling&quot; each of them along).</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+DaveJoria" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Dave Joria</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-10T06:11:17-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112732791016140171187" oid="112732791016140171187" >Mark Arndt</a></span> - The Kicker thing sounds neat- any chance you could elaborate?</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112732791016140171187" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Mark Arndt</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-11T11:47:17-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Sure! The term Kicker comes from Ron Edwards (of Sorceror fame) and refers to the initial incident, which requires a huge choice from the character and propels their story thereafter (will Luke leave Tatooine and become a Jedi like his father, or bury his aunt and uncle and get on with moisture farming?). It launches the character on their story arc.<br><br>For Fate, I think it could just be a PC&#39;s Kicker Aspect with the normal mechanics. The GM can compel it to add developments to that story arc (or be bought off). The player gets more permission (than usual?) for adding story details and coincidences when spending a fate point on their Kicker (&quot;Vader&#39;s on that ship. I&#39;m endangering the mission&quot;). It&#39;s the lever the player gets to pull to really move their own story the way they want to move it.<br><br>Could be too meta for some players, so seems best to check in and see who wants to use it and who doesn&#39;t.</div></div></div></body></html>
