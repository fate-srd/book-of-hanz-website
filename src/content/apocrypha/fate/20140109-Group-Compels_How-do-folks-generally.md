We&#39;re doing an investigation here.&quot;<br><br>The werewolf&#39;s like, &quot;What part of Insatiable is unclear to you all?&quot;<br><br>So the GM is like, &quot;Okay, you have _Insatiable Hunger for Clerical Personnel_ and you&#39;re in an office with a secretary, so it makes sense that you&#39;d eat them. This goes wrong for you when...&quot; and this is when the GM looks at the rest of the group, &quot;...your friends beat the shit out of you, knock you unconscious, and leave you somewhere random without any of your stuff so they can get on with their lives?&quot;<br><br>And everyone else is like, &quot;Yeah, dude, seriously. We&#39;re trying to do an investigation here.&quot;<br><br>The werewolf&#39;s like, &quot;I dig the angst of you people trying to protect you from me, and me from myself, in an aggressive way.&quot;<br><br>Werewolf gets a fate point. GM frames a new scene and is like, &quot;So, there&#39;s a crime scene at this office building now, but you can still get access to the people...&quot;<br><br>Like, the question you have to ask yourself at every turn is, &quot;What <i>really</i> constitutes things going wrong for X? Who is okay with being affected by this compel?&quot;<br><br>Because imagine that same group being like, &quot;OMG hilarious, you just ate a secretary. We&#39;re so fucked.&quot; And then the GM&#39;s like, &quot;So, this goes wrong when you all get arrested? Fate points for everyone?&quot; And everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Hilarious. Sure.&quot;<br><br>And I know I&#39;m oversimplifying, because there&#39;s not an &quot;everyone else&quot; a lot of times. So imagine more talking and stuff there.<br><br>Also, remember that veto-ing out can also mean, should often mean, <i>that you find an in-fiction way to avoid the complication</i>. I added that in on page 71. The retroactive only thing is old Fate. This is new, shiny Fate. So you have a way to go in that case. Not just &quot;this doesn&#39;t affect me,&quot; but, &quot;I skillfully avoid being affected by this and accomplish my aims&quot;. <br><br>So I guess, two techniques: as Jack said, pay out only those actually disadvantaged by the thing that goes wrong. Second, always err on the side of not pissing on anyone&#39;s fun.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T20:51:00-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Sorry for the paraphrase... at work :)<br><br>For the first vector - yeah.  Social contract stuff.<br><br>For the second vector - I like it.  Let him have the compel, but then change the complication to something more acceptable to the group.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by the &#39;retroactive-only&#39; thing.  I generally do try to find the in-fiction way to avoid the complication, especially for compels handling multiple members.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T20:52:08-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Sorry for the paraphrase... at work :)<br><br>For the first vector - yeah.  Social contract stuff.<br><br>For the second vector - I like it.  Let him have the compel, but then change the complication to something more acceptable to the group.  I like that a lot.  I think the thing that I hadn&#39;t fully internalized was the <b>decision</b> being the key to the compel, that it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re <b>successful</b> at it.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by the &#39;retroactive-only&#39; thing.  I generally do try to find the in-fiction way to avoid the complication, especially for compels handling multiple members.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+LeonardBalsera" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Leonard Balsera</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T21:21:01-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I meant that in prior Fate games, we always said that buying out of a compel was a meta thing that made it never happen.

If people buy off a compel I just move on as if it never happened. This is much better because it gives the feeling of a disaster averted and a brief moment of narrative awesome in exchange for the price paid of a shiny fate point to avert the compel.<br><br>A recent example: The pirate ship&#39;s doctor who is afraid of blood nearly fainted. He was holding a bag of booty at the time so I offered as a compel that the bag hits the boat&#39;s gunwhale as he faints and spills open, revealing the treasure to a rival band of pirates. He paid it off so I just moved on. It would have been more fun if he&#39;d had the presence of mind even as he fainted to hug the bag to his chest so it wasn&#39;t spilled. <br><br>Thanks for pointing this out, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/101924479447471392932" oid="101924479447471392932" >Leonard Balsera</a></span>!</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JosephHines" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Joseph Hines</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-10T07:19:13-0500</span></span><span> - Updated: <span itemprop="dateModified">2014-01-10T07:19:25-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I&#39;d let the players all vote on it.
