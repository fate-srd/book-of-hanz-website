Usually, a player will not suggest something like that out of the blue. I think there are 2 ways this can go:<br><br>The Aspect is inconveniencing him temporarily. Maybe he is &quot;disarmed&quot; in a club or something like that, but he might have wanted to smuggle in a weapon, but he didn&#39;t think about it at the time. This can easily be seen as him refusing the compel on &quot;disarmed&quot; in that situation, because he smuggled in a weapon in. This is definitely a retcon, as &quot;disarmed&quot; was an established fact, but the rules provide a way around this.<br><br>Another thing could be that the player doesn&#39;t like an established fact at all. Not that it is inconveniencing him in a given situation, but the whole idea of that aspect is bothering him. Maybe the game has shifted in a direction that makes the aspect not work for him anymore, or he wasn&#39;t happy with it in the first place but didn&#39;t speak up. Paying a Fate point to retcon the aspect might be his way to try to invoke a rule in order to get rid of this, without actually bringing it up. Maybe he doesn&#39;t even realize the reason why he wants to retcon it.<br><br>Now granted, if it&#39;s something like &quot;I know we said I just take the peashooter, but I&#39;d rather have the bazoooka now&quot;, I&#39;d probably say no, as well, but I&#39;d first try to see if there was a good reason for the player to suggest a retcon.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-04-06T18:21:53-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re saying in your second point there, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112230078537377625576" oid="112230078537377625576" >Paul Kießhauer</a></span>.  Changing a character aspect is just that, changing an aspect, and is totally normal.<br><br>For the first, that&#39;s fine, but again, I&#39;d make this not a retcon - you <b>were</b> disarmed, but because you have <b><i>Friends In Low Places</i></b> you&#39;re able to get a new gun.  Or because you&#39;ve got <b><i>Hidden Weapons Everywhere</i></b> you know where to hide one so that you weren&#39;t fully disarmed.<br><br>The third is I think where the real meat of the question is.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+MarcusMorrisey" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Marcus Morrisey</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-04-06T19:11:39-0400</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">I play fast and loose.

Basically, I wanted to say that someone wanting to spend a Fate point to work around something can be a red flag. They might not realize that the reason they are doing it, is because they just really dislike the aspect and the concept it represents, they just try to make it go away. If that&#39;s the case, the solution would be to talk about it and identify the problem further than &quot;wanting to retcon&quot;.<br><br>Well, I feel like changing &quot;disarmed&quot; to &quot;not fully disarmed&quot; is (or rather can be) a retcon, but that might be nitpicking on my part. Your suggestions obviously work.<br><br>I was trying to get into the third option more right now, but I can&#39;t think of a retcon right now, that couldn&#39;t be solved by turning it into a reveal.<br>The only things that might not work as a reveal would be my example above, changing the peashooter for the bazooka. But that&#39;s a case of &quot;not having the right tools for the job&quot;, which I would handle as a compel or just not bother with, as I don&#39;t like the &quot;having to be prepared for everything&quot; paranoia that comes with enforcing this.<br><br>Do you have an example of an edge case?

Now, it still might be possible for a player to &quot;declare a new detail&quot; that would make dealing with Jimmy&#39;s new demands easier, but there could be a price for that as well.</i><br><br>If there was no measurable benefit from the event that they&#39;re trying to retcon, I might be more lenient.<br><br><i>Sophia met with Jimmy the Rat, but he just wasted her time.
